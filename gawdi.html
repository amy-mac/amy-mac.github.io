			<h1>Current Times</h1>
			<p>Which brings us to the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of my twenties and what's going on in my life today. When I first moved back to the Bay Area in 2009 I was freelancing doing print design, web graphics, and multimedia. I realized that print design was, unfortunately, a dying art and started building a portfolio in Interface Design instead. I felt that I wasn't as good at Interface Design as I was at Print Design and after my iMac was stolen from my house causing me to lose 15 years of work and my new budding portfolio, I decided to return to my roots and start doing front-end development again.</p>

			<p>When I'm not coding and pursuing a new career, I am usually doing one of these things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Seeing live theatre shows</li>
				<li><a href="http://theamysloan.com/theatre/" title="Some of Amy's past theatre experience">Performing in live theatre shows</a></li>
				<li>Watching episodes of Star Trek with my husband</li>
				<li>Participating in a local Star Trek club: the <a href="http://usslomaprieta.org/" title="USS Loma Prieta" target="_blank">USS Loma Prieta</a></li>
				<li>Playing piano</li>
				<li><a href="http://youtu.be/Kd6KU191tFQ" title="Les Miserables Medley">Performing in an adult choir</a></li>
				<li>Hanging out at tech events</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amy_sloan/sets/72157626611783178/" title="Amy's Pie Baking">Baking pies</a></li>
				<li>Reading books</li>
				<li>Knitting and/or crocheting</li>
				<li>Playing video and/or computer games</li>
				<li>Playing with my adorable cats</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So...I have a lot of interests and the list is always growing, but I've been putting all my hobbies on hold while I pursue my web development passions. The cats do try to help out a little though.</p>

			<p>What's in store for the future? Hopefully a successful career in web development and a lot more of all my hobbies and interests. One thing is for certain: it's going to be a fun journey!</p>
