        <p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of the last week up to my elbows in fixing computers, setting up computers, and general technology. It should be enough to make someone&rsquo;s head explode. I sometimes think, &ldquo;What would we do without it?&rdquo; and yet I am the last generation that can remember what it was like without it. We get so used to habits though I can understand how we get so lazy. The other day I was going to ask a friend to give me his address before I stopped having a printer so I could print out directions from mapquest because how in the world would I find it otherwise and then I thought, &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll do it the old fashioned way and you&rsquo;ll deal with it!&rdquo; as memories of friends giving extensive directions about &ldquo;turn left on this street, go 5 blocks&hellip;&rdquo; flooded my brain.</p>

<p>I sometimes think about all the things that we take for granted and I start to understand the way people much older than me must feel. I have a brother 10 years younger than me and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll never know what it&rsquo;s like to use a pay phone, or write letters to friends. I love technology and it continues to amaze me, but there are things that I think should never change. I&rsquo;m not comfortable with a world where everyone has a feed straight to their brain like that book Asher read. I want to curl up with the written word and scribble out my thoughts. I think things should enhance our life but not replace it, much like relationships, and with people spending so much time with their &ldquo;loved ones&rdquo; (iPhones, laptops, et al) isn&rsquo;t that all it really is? Another relationship in your life. You don&rsquo;t give up your whole self to your lover, (at least you shouldn&rsquo;t), so why should we give our whole selves up to our computers?</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been without a computer for longer than a couple days since the year 2005, and even then I had a computer at work to turn to; and before that it must have been about 1998. I am a total computer geek but I am looking forward to my first ever vacation, taking place in a foreign country. I have made the decision to not even take my computer. I almost look forward to it, to get back to those glory days of adventures outside and experiencing everything the world dared to show me. I also seem to be of the last generation that had to know how to entertain itself without devices. Now all you hear from the younger ones is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored,&rdquo; unless they have a constant stream of internet, guitar hero, and TV all at once.</p>

<p>I suppose there are no answers, and I suppose I&rsquo;m somewhat odd. I read books instead of watching TV. I do dishes by hand before I remember there&rsquo;s a dishwasher. I&rsquo;d rather walk than drive a car. Maybe my dysfunctional upbringing has something to do with it. Maybe the lack of electricity and luxuries was an advantage in disguise.</p>

<p>But now I ramble. It&rsquo;s 11pm and I am at an airport waiting to fly all night to the East Coast. Don&rsquo;t listen to the sleepy woman.</p>
