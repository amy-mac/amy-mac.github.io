    <p>Yet again it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve posted because parenting and work keeps me super busy, so I rarely have time to even be on my computer. I miss blogging and there was no way I wasn&rsquo;t going to do my annual review, so at least there&rsquo;s some kind of an update.</p>

    <p>Recently my family went on a roadtrip to Idaho for my father&rsquo;s wedding. It was the first big roadtrip with the children, aged 4 months and 16 months and in order to give the girls sufficient time out of the car we stopped and ate at restaurants/diners for every meal. So of course it was during these breaks that I would try and nurse my 4 month old baby, Athena. Since we were driving through Nevada and Oregon during the summertime it was very hot and we were all tired from the drive; so while I normally try to cover up with a baby blanket while I&rsquo;m nursing in public, I didn&rsquo;t do so a single time while we were traveling.</p>

    <p>A couple days ago I saw post after post on Facebook made by white people that kept saying the same thing about the Baltimore riots. The sentiment tended to be, &ldquo;I get why people are mad, <em>BUT why can&rsquo;t they protest peacefully&hellip;</em>&rdquo; and it really started to infuriate me, because 1) No they don&rsquo;t get it, and 2) Everyone was focusing on the riots as opposed to the loss of human life like the former was so much more important. I&rsquo;m not saying I advocate riots, and it&rsquo;s also worth noting that lots of people did protest peacefully, but the riots are a symptom and not the root problem. Now I&rsquo;m not saying I understand what black people are going through, because how could I? The entire point of this post is that I&rsquo;m willing to admit that I can&rsquo;t even imagine what it&rsquo;s like to live with that kind of oppression and fear and I wish more (white) people would recognize their privilege. I may be half Mexican but I have never identified as anything but white. Let me tell you a little story about my privilege.</p>

    <p>Last June I lost a good friend whom I valued greatly due to an overprotective husband and miscommunication. Honestly I still haven’t gotten over it and dream about her still. I try to keep myself from thinking about the situation because it really upsets me but I can’t do anything about it but move on with my life.</p>

    <p>During Jesse&rsquo;s Spring Break we took a trip to Virginia for a number of reasons. My little sister Katie graduated college this May and we weren&rsquo;t going to be able to go out there due to Jesse&rsquo;s teaching duties, but I still wanted to pay her a visit. Originally Jesse couldn&rsquo;t imagine why he&rsquo;d ever want to go to Virginia, but when he found out that Monticello is in the very town that Katie goes to college, he became interested. The trip then evolved into one that would satisfy Jesse&rsquo;s history interests while I got to enjoy being in an area I loved, and used to live in, as well as see some of my good friends. I assured Jesse that the area was full of history but it wasn&rsquo;t until we were there that he connected geographically exactly where it was I had lived. Needless to say, he was pleased and excited.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working at Coupa for a full month now. I like it. I feel comfortable there in a way I haven&rsquo;t felt since I worked for the Shining Stars Foundation in the glory days. I&rsquo;ve lost track of the number of contributions I&rsquo;ve made now. It isn&rsquo;t all that glamourous and sometimes my eyes glaze over from a full day of doing nothing but reading code, but I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
