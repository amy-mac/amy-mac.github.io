        <p>There wasn’t much discussion of where we’d be going for our Honeymoon. Scotland was the natural choice. I had never been the UK, and had always wanted to visit it, and Jesse was keen on introducing his new bride to his heritage. So as soon as we got engaged I set out planning and researching for the honeymoon and along the way have grown increasingly fascinated by Scotland’s history. Here’s a breakdown of our trip:</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

</figure>

<p>While enthusiastic about arriving in Edinburgh, 48 hours of no sleep had finally caught up to me and coupled with not having eaten in a while, I was exhausted and emotional as soon as we got to the Royal Mile. On top of this I was unsuccessfully trying to find a memory card for the camera so that we could take pictures; it was a very stressful first half of the day. The things that we originally had planned on doing ended up not happening and I had an emotional breakdown in a bar where Jesse took me to find some food. He sat there smiling and supportive while I cried, and then after I had some food my energy improved a little. We had a walking tour scheduled that afternoon through Mercat Tours, which was booked from the company I worked for (<a href="http://www.viator.com">Viator</a>) entitled “<a href="http://www.viator.com/tours/Edinburgh/Secrets-of-Edinburghs-Royal-Mile-Afternoon-Walking-Tour/d739-293401SECRETS">Secrets of the Royal Mile</a>,” which I felt obligated to go to, since it was complimentary, but it was a very hard tour to get through because of my exhaustion. I was literally falling asleep on my feet. I’d start to drift off and as my knees buckled it would startle me back awake. I felt bad because I didn’t want the tour guide to think he was boring me. The bits and pieces I caught when I wasn’t falling asleep were very interesting, and we got to go into the old parliament building and see a special room where traditionally, those conversing about matters in law would pace up and down the room, with the intention that no one would be able to listen in and eavesdrop. After the tour ended we decided that it was for the best that we forsake trying to do anything else and go back to the flat to sleep. After a great nap that lasted a few hours, we set back out to be tourists and grabbed some dinner from The Pie Shoppe, and all my dreams came true. Delicious hand pies for cheap! We then went to a bar on the Royal Mile to get a drink. I basically only drank ciders the whole time were in Scotland, and was thrilled that they have such a wide selection of ciders in all the bars there.</p>

<p>At 10pm we used our Edinburgh Passes to go on the <a href="http://www.auldreekietours.com/tours.html">Auld Reekie Terror Tour</a>, because nothing says romantic honeymoon like learning about the dark and scary parts of a city’s history. Our tour guide was really fantastic. First he took us on a short walk around the Royal Mile to talk about some of the gory and terrible things that happened around there, but the true delight of the evening was him taking us down into Edinburgh’s underground vaults. We started out seeing the torture museum, which had torture instruments on display. I was familiar with many of the devices already but there was one that I haven’t seen before that I find particularly horrifying—most likely because I find being eaten alive to be horrifying. The device involved a sort of small cage being placed over the abdomen of someone laying down, and on top of the cage were hot coals. A rat or sometimes a cat is placed inside this cage, with no bottom except for the flesh of the person. The person is interrogated while the animal, trying desperately to escape the heat, starts eating their way through the flesh. Cheery, isn’t it?</p>

</figure>

<p>After the torture museum, we went down into the vaults proper. The vaults have such a fascinating history that I could probably write pages about it. Edinburgh was originally built on these series of bridges that had these rooms in the arches and as the city grew to be somewhat two stories, they had this whole “underground” world that existed in these vaults. After seeing some of the rooms and hearing stories about what took place down there—including a MacKinnon ghost that haunts the place—the tour ended and we headed back to the flat.</p>

  <figcaption>This was one of the rooms that had a lot of horrible things happen in it.</figcaption>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

<p>This sunny day started out a lot better, having rested well the night before. We had breakfast at Old Jock’s Pie Shoppe. There is nothing like meat pie and mash for breakfast. I was hesitant to visit the castle without being able to take pictures, so we instead made our way over to the <a href="http://www.thedungeons.com/edinburgh/en/">Edinburgh Dungeon</a> for the first stop of the day to make the best use of our 2-day Edinburgh Pass since we didn’t really use it the first day. The Edinburgh Dungeon helped us delve even more to the dark and gory side of Scotland. We learned all about Sawney Bean and his incestuous, cannibalistic family and how the King eventually brought them to justice in a gruesome manner. We then took a bus over to the Edinburgh Zoo and walked around looking at all the animals, but the BIG attraction was the Penguin Parade.</p>

</ul>

<p>As we were riding the bus back to the Royal Mile, we found out from some friendly locals where we could get a memory card for the camera and then I became about 10 times happier. Our next stop was lunch at <a href="http://www.thewitchery.com/">The Witchery</a>. I had read that it was one of the top places to dine, and since they had quotes on their website from both Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh taking about how great it was, I wanted to make sure I ate there at some point during our trip. If it’s good enough for Broadway composers and producers, then it’s good enough for this thespian! The ambiance at the Witchery is definitely one of the things that sets it apart; it’s very Gothic and charming. Going into the restaurant I didn’t realize that it was such a “fancy” restaurant. I felt really low-class while dining there. Our servers were awesome and everything, but I definitely felt awkward in there. We also ended up spending way more money than we intended. In fact it’s the most that I’ve ever spent at any restaurant, ever. But afterwards we figured it was our one splurge meal for the vacation.</p>

</ul>

<p>Continuing to want to make the best use of the Edinburgh Pass, we decided to head to Calton Hill after our late lunch and check out the Nelson Monument, which boasted the best 360 degree views of the city. We found this boast is quite accurate. The never-ending winding stairs up to the top of the Nelson Monument was entirely worth it. It was gorgeous and we got some really great pictures of the surrounding area. After climbing back down we chilled there on the hill for a while just enjoying the views and sunshine.</p>

</ul>

<p>After that we headed down to Canongate Kirk at the bottom of the Royal Mile. We didn’t get to go inside because there was a concert going on, but we were able to at least walk around the cemetery, where lots of famous locals are buried. I find old cemeteries quite beautiful (and peaceful) so it was nice getting to walk around. I then hunted down a Clan MacKinnon tartan scarf, because it was cold enough to wear a scarf, but I hadn’t brought one, and I figured if I’m going to buy another scarf to add to my huge collection then it should at least have some meaning. It ended up being a great buy for all those dreary weather moments in Scotland.</p>

<p>We lost track of time and had to hightail it to New Town where we had a reservation for another activity through my company: Whisky Tasting &amp; Dinner. This was one of the highlights of the trip in the restaurant/bar department. The activity took place at Iglu Restaurant, and they pride themselves on fresh food sourced locally. The menu actually details where they receive all their different ingredients from, and the food was delicious. After the great dinner we went downstairs to their bar area and sat down for our intimate whisky tasting. It was just us and 2 men who were locals. The tutor walked us through how scotch gets made and then we tasted 4 kinds, and discussed the smell and taste of each. I only did this tasting because I knew my husband would love it, but I didn’t get much joy out of drinking any of it. The 4th was so strong I couldn’t drink it at all, and whenever the tutor asked me to describe the taste, the only response I could give is, “It tastes like burning.”</p>

  <figcaption>Glamis Castle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We rented a car and got up bright and early to drive up to Glamis Castle, an hour and a half north of Edinburgh to see the Strathmore Highland Games. It’s the only Highland Games that were going to be happening around the time we were going to be going to Scotland and so we made sure we’d be able to go. Everything about the day was delightful. We got there before it started and took a couple of laps around the competition field, and sat down and watched some of the junior events that came before the official games started. We watched the opening ceremony and then headed over to Glamis Castle to take a tour during a lull in the games. We got to see many rooms where the Queen Mother slept and grew up, as well as portraits of her on the walls. We also got to see the room where MacBeth killed Duncan (only fictionally though).</p>

</ul>

<p>We had lunch there at the castle and then headed back to the Highland Games. There we watched the Tug-o-War championship, the Caber Toss, the 56 lb. weight toss, throwing the hammer, pipe band competitions, and highland dancing. It was a very non-touristy event; just locals doing what they do. Also we had chips and curry (french fries drowned in gravy)! It was delicious. After the games ended and all the trophies were handed out we headed back to the castle to take one of the nature walks through the property. We got to see the wonderfully hairy highland cows and very beautiful property. After that we headed back to Edinburgh and had a quiet night inside.</p>

<p><strong>A few videos from the games:</strong></p>

  <figcaption>The Elephant House</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We sought out The Elephant House for breakfast, since I love elephants but it turns out it’s also a tourist attractions as “the birthplace of Harry Potter” due to JK Rowling writing the entire first book at the cafe. They had really delicious food and such a large selection that I decided we’d have to come back again. And of course they had shortbread in the shape of an elephant, as well as elephant paraphernalia everywhere. In the back, the windows show a view of the castle. I would certainly be hanging out in this place a lot if I were a local. After breakfast we hopped on the train to Glasgow. Upon arrival we immediately got on the Hop On Hop Off Bus we had pre-booked to see the city. It was a great way to learn about the city and see much more of it than we could have on our own with only less than a full day there. We hopped off towards the end of the circuit because it was getting close to our reservation at The Willows Tea Room, of Charles Rennie Mackintosh fame. After spending quite a bit of time in a book store close by, we sat down and had our afternoon tea and goodies. I didn’t like that they gave you a random assortment of sandwiches instead of letting you pick some out, since neither Jesse or I eat seafood and there were more than a few salmon sandwiches. Overall I’d say there wasn’t anything spectacular about the Willows Tearoom. The scones were great though.</p>

  <figcaption>Overlooking Glasgow Cathedral from the Necropolis</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After tea we got to take a free tour of the City Chambers—it was like a palace! Very gorgeous inside and very fun to learn about its history. After that, we went to Glasgow Cathedral and looked all around inside and then went to the Necropolis. Oh, the Necropolis—this was absolutely my favorite thing about Glasgow, and I’m not sure if that’s saying something about me, or about Glasgow. We climbed up to the top and walked all around enjoying the views and taking pictures of the especially cool looking graves and monuments. I was amazed that there was still so much available space in this sprawling metropolis of graves; someone did their planning well. After that, Jesse wanted to get a drink, so we found a bar that claimed to be the “oldest running bar in the U.K.” A couple drinks later we were back on the train for Edinburgh, unfortunately late for the ceilidh that I had wanted to go to. So instead, we found a place that serves traditional haggis and had dinner, then called it a night.</p>

<p>We were up bright and early to obtain our rental car that would service us for the next 5 days. We left Edinburgh to head towards the Isle of Skye, taking the scenic route through the highlands. Our first big stop of the day was in Dunning at St. Serf’s Church to see a Pictish Cross, which was really quite incredible. This was in the middle of nowhere, so we were the only ones there and the man who worked there gave us an in-depth explanation of the cross. Towards the end of us looking around I left a small donation and the man was so excited that he gave me a short book about the Picts, which got me really excited. So happiness was had all around.</p>

</ul>

<p>Continuing on we stopped at the Tayside Inn for lunch, another recommendation from my Lonely Planet book. We mutually agreed on this place but for different reasons. It ended up being just the right place. Quiet, good food, good drinks, and a nice view, though Jesse couldn’t stop snicker about “taysiders” while we were next to the River Tay. We didn’t make any additional stops on the way because Jesse was anxious to get to Eileen Donan Castle before it closed. Unfortunately we didn’t make it in time, but it just meant we couldn’t see the inside. We were still able to walk around outside the castle and take pictures.</p>

<p>From there it was only a hop, skip, and a jump over the Skye bridge to the Isle of Skye. We were staying at the MacKinnon Country House and the innkeeper Ian said to us, “Welcome home!” when we were checking in. Another highlight of the MacKinnon Country House was that it had elephants everywhere! The people in Scotland are obviously kindred spirits. We relaxed in our room, having some tea, shortbread, and reading our new books and then went down to the dining room to have dinner. I had a small bird (pheasant, maybe?) that I had never had before, which prompted me to make the bird dance after I had eaten off all the meat. I told you, we know how to do romance. A coworker had told me that I had to have sticky toffee pudding while in Scotland and so far I hadn’t encountered it, but there it was on the MacKinnon Country House menu. It was delicious! I kind of became obsessed after that and had it every single night thereafter. I also excitedly asked the kitchen about some berries on the plate that I had never seen before in my life. They were red currants! I explained to them that we don’t have them in America, and as a pie baker I like to know my berries.</p>

<p>Our first full day in the Isle of Skye started with an awesome breakfast at our inn. We planned on exploring the northern part of Skye and headed towards Dunvegan Castle. On our way we stopped at a prehistoric site, which was incredible. I also got a big kick out of all the sheep that were hanging out around the site. After that we continued on to Dunvegan Castle, the seat of Clan MacLeod. Since the family still lives in the castle, pictures are not allowed while you’re touring the inside. I expected it to be cold but the heating was actually pretty good inside. We didn’t get to see too many rooms, but we did see the famous fairy flag and learn the story behind it. We then walked around the castle grounds a bit but we were getting hungry so we didn’t stay long.</p>

</ul>

<p>We continued driving north along the coastline hoping to find a place to eat as we continued our route. We ended up going to the Stein Inn at the suggestion of the Lonely Planet book, and it was basically in the middle of nowhere on the coast, so exactly the type of place we like. After having our delightful Scottish fare we continued our journey, stopping at a store where they hand-spin their own yarn. I wanted to buy some nice Scottish yarn to knit with, and my very wonderful husband sat patiently while I indecisively reviewed my choices. I ended up buying some extremely soft alpaca yarn, and some 100% Scottish wool gray yarn to make socks for Jesse. After that we stopped at the Kilmuir cemetery to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_MacDonald">Flora MacDonald</a>’s grave and were pleasantly surprised to find a multitude of MacKinnon graves, as well. After that the coastline wraps around and starts heading south again and our next stop was at Kilt Rock. We got out for a moment and enjoyed the views and then continued heading south towards the Old Man of Storr. Here our day turned a little sour. Due to not enough research beforehand we ended up putting ourselves through quite the miserable hike with no reward. So then we were wet, and it was getting late, and we were hungry, so we hurried into the Saucy Mary upon arriving back in Kyleakin and managed to order food 10 minutes before the kitchen closed.</p>

<h2 id="day-7">Day 7</h2>

<p>We woke up to a beautiful morning full of sunshine, something I wasn’t sure I’d get to see on the Isle of Skye. After making sure to eat a hearty Scottish breakfast, we headed out towards Carbost, where we’d be going on a tour of the Talisker Distillery. First though, we made a stop at one of the places where you’d start hiking the Cuillins and took some pictures as well as stopping at the bar there for me to get coffee and Jesse to get a beer.</p>

<ul class="clearing-thumbs small-block-grid-3" data-clearing="">

</ul>

<p>At the Talisker Distillery we took the tour and Jesse got another bottle to add to his collection. Afterwards we sat outside on a park bench eating our lunch and making friends with a furry cat that was wandering around. Then we were on our way to the main attraction of the day: our hiking trip in the famous Cuillins. We chose a trail that wasn’t going to be too hard for me, but also wasn’t going to be really simple, and it was also going to take us past the Fairy Pools and I like anything that involves fairies. We parked the car and set out along the trail, and the weather started out quite sunny and nice. Jesse hiked with no shirt on, and stopped occasionally to don a Star Trek: The Next Generation uniform shirt to document his away mission to the Isle of Skye. The trail followed a very pretty river and before long we reached the Fairy Pools and the underwater arch that I had been told to watch out for. There was a couple who had just finished swimming in the Fairy Pools and when Jesse found out that they swam underneath the underwater arch he just had to do the same thing and was down there throwing off his clothes before I knew what was happening, so I settled myself down on a rock up above and got video footage of him in the water. I have a coworker who lived in Scotland for 3 years and she said that Jesse definitely has Scottish blood to be going in those cold waters. We then continued along the path following the route that I had looked up beforehand. The further along we got the less people we saw until there was no one around but us hiking…well, and the sheep. It was very peaceful and beautiful and we both enjoyed the rest of the hike.</p>

</ul>

<p>After the hike we headed back towards Kyleakin and stopped into the Broadford Inn in Broadford to eat dinner while it was still early enough. Yet another recommendation in my Lonely Planet book, we were delighted to discover upon entering this bar/restaurant that they claimed to be the home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drambuie">Drambuie</a> (a MacKinnon drink)! After some great food, drinks, and sticky toffee pudding, we went to finally view our family castle (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisteal_Maol">Caisteal Maol</a>) up close and spent quite a bit of time walking inside and around it and enjoying the lovely views. Jesse had been there before of course, but was eager to see it again. I stood in wonder and awe thinking about Jesse’s ancestors living there 700 years ago, and being jerks with their chain across the water, haha. Now I have to explain: so the MacKinnon Clan ran a chain across to the mainland from the Isle of Skye so that they could charge a toll to any ships passing through. There’s also rumors that Saucy Mary, a Norse princess who married into the Clan, was very friendly with the sailors.</p>

</ul>

<p>I picked some flowers from around the castle to take home as a 2nd wedding bouquet, since my first one was given away to the winner of the lightsaber tournament. We stopped at Saucy Mary for a last drink and then called it a night.</p>

  <figcaption>Abbey of Iona from the ferry</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We left the Isle of Skye bright and early to drive south to Lochaline to catch the ferry to the Isle of Mull, on our way to the Isle of Iona. The Isle of Mull was our least favorite place of this trip, but at least we were only driving through it to get somewhere else. Our first glimpse of the Isle of Iona was under the cover of sunshine, and we marveled at the beauty of both the water and the island as we approached on this quick ferry ride from Mull. We only had a few hours until the Abbey closed so we quickly dropped our stuff off at our hotel and started walking over. We also walked through the ruins of an old nunnery. Unfortunately the weather turned sour while we were at the Abbey, and the storm was bad enough that it was hard to be outside long, so we didn’t get to see much of the cemetery. The inside of the Abbey was great, however. We learned all about it on one of the free tours walking around, and got to see the sarcophagus of Abbott John MacKinnon right by the main altar. After the tour, the guide shared some paperwork with us talking about the last MacKinnon Abbott, who is called “the green Abbott.” He kept with concubines, used the church’s money for his daughter’s dowry, and almost drove the abbey to ruin. We also got to see “MacKinnon’s Cross” in the abbey’s museum.</p>

</ul>

<p>With all the rain and bluster we ended up heading back to the Argyll Hotel, where we were staying, and relaxed before dinner. We had a great dinner there at the Argyll Hotel, and it was the only time I had more than one drink while we were in Scotland. So 2 strong ciders, and 1 glass of champagne later, I was pretty tipsy.</p>

<h2 id="day-9">Day 9</h2>

<p>The Isle of Iona was once again bright and sunny in the morning as we made our way to the ferry to head back to the mainland. My spirits were a bit dampened by finding out that someone had made a bunch of fraudulent charges to my debit card the night before, but luckily I was able to block the card from any additional charges being made and tried to tell myself not to worry until I got back to the States. The funny thing is that I wasn’t using my debit card at all during our trip, and I still am not sure when or how the number got stolen. But it has all been resolved now, thankfully. On our way back across the Isle of Mull we decided to search out a place called MacKinnon’s Cave that is mentioned in the Lonely Planet book. Apparently some monks took refuge in this cave and stayed there a while, created an altar, etc. It was quite a perilous trek out to the cave and Jesse had to actually swim to the entrance. The cave is really deep so Jesse didn’t get to see much while inside. We’re determined that our next trip to Scotland we’ll visit the cave with proper supplies to get to it and view the inside.</p>

<p>The day was pretty uneventful after that, as we were driving most of the day back to Edinburgh and got stuck in some bad traffic at one point. We had dinner that night at a place we had already been to before, because it was my favorite place there: The Pie Maker. I bought two hand-held pies, one to eat there and one for the road and then we went out for a drink.</p>

  <figcaption>Visiting Edinburgh Castle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This was our last full day in Scotland, so we wanted to make the most of it. We had breakfast at The Elephant House again, and each had a full Scottish breakfast. Then we headed on over to the Edinburgh Castle to finally see it (something we were supposed to do on our first day). We unfortunately ended up having to pay twice the admission to get in, due to a mishap of ordering tickets in advance and them expiring but Jesse assured me that it was worth it. Besides having to deal with the rude and annoying tourists, which seemed to be out in spades at the castle, it really was quite wonderful. We did one of the free tours around the castle and learned a lot more than we would have if we had walked around by ourselves. Our favorite tidbit was that the cannons all around the walls of the castle are just decoration. During Queen Victoria’s reign she visited the castle and decided that all castles MUST have cannons because it just looks better. So they took a bunch of cannons they weren’t using anymore from some naval ships and planted them all along the walls. There is one cannon at the castle though that is an exception and that’s Mons Meg, a very large cannon that was used to defend the castle a few hundred years ago. I unfortunately was unable to get a picture of it because of some children who were ignoring the “Do not climb on cannon” sign, <em>and</em> ignoring the castle worker who kept requesting for them to stop climbing on it. We took our time getting to see everything and then left and went to lunch.</p>

</ul>

<p>We then made our way down to the other end of the Royal Mile to see The Palace of Holyrood House, which is the Queen’s residence whenever she’s in Edinburgh. They give you an audio guide when you walk in and it’s really great to explore everything at your own pace and get more information on certain things when you want it. After the palace we walked right next door to Holyrood Park and started our ascent to Arthur’s Seat. We had to stop and rest many times during the climb because hiking doesn’t agree with my lungs, but it was well worth the climb to the top. Once up there we took a lot of pictures and hung out for a bit. I became quite anxious watching Jesse take pictures from the edge and had to look away. The journey back down was much easier. For our last dinner before leaving Scotland we went to the Tolbooth Tavern on the Royal Mile. Jesse had a fond memory of talking to one of the bartenders there during his last trip to Scotland, and they had the kind of food and dessert we were wanting. It was a very pleasant dinner and evening and a great end to our stay.</p>

<h2 id="day-11">Day 11</h2>

<p>The journey back to the U.S. was kind of a nightmare, mainly the connection at the Dublin Airport. I won’t go into details but we never want to go back to that airport again. We arrived in New York City, exhausted because of the time change, but got checked into our place and then set out to walk around and figure out which show we were going to see that night. There aren’t a lot of shows available on a Monday night and out of the few that were playing it was harder than I thought it was going to be to get tickets. We entered the lottery drawing for Newsies but didn’t win. In the end we ended up getting tickets to see Alan Cumming’s one-man show of Macbeth. Unfortunately my fatigue plus not having any coffee before the show meant that I was unable to stay awake for the second half. I’m totally bummed about it. That’s twice now that I’ve tried to see a show on Broadway but was sleep deprived and couldn’t stay awake. The first half of it was really great though. I have long loved Alan Cumming as a performer and this was quite the performance piece. After the show we made one last attempt to get my picture with the George M. Cohan statue, but it was still blocked off because of a World War Z promotional event. I was able to get within 15 feet of the status though, so it wasn’t a complete bust. We were pretty tired and out of it at that point, so we went straight back to the flat and went to sleep.</p>

<h2 id="day-12">Day 12</h2>

<p>I was determined to get a good bagel for breakfast before going to the airport, but we had to settle on a bodega when we couldn’t find the bagel shops we were looking for. We then had some confusion with public transportation but finally made it to the Newark Airport and on our way back home. Our cat seemed to be quite content to stay at her grandma’s when we tried to take her home, but after getting home she went right back to her cuddling routines, so I’m sure she must have missed us.</p>

<hr />

<p>This was an amazing trip and a dream come true, and it was made possible by all of our friends and family who generously donated to our honeymoon registry. Everyone in Scotland was so friendly, the food was amazing, and the landscapes all gorgeous. I’m very much looking forward to going back again to see parts of the country that we didn’t get to see, and to also spend more time in places we really enjoyed, like the Isle of Skye. First though, our next international trip will be to Paris, which is the top place that I’ve wanted to visit for the last 14 years.</p>

<p>There were a ton of really wonderful pictures from our honeymoon that didn’t get posted in this blog, so if you’re interested in seeing more of our pictures from Scotland you can find them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amy_sloan/sets/72157634303985542/">my Flickr</a>.</p>
