    <p>Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I’m usually the first to admit that I’m too proud, I’m a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, “What’s wrong with you?” and then I felt bad and guilty. I don’t know what’s really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.</p>

    <p>I went to this completely amazing park last weekend in Berkeley. It’s right on the bay, and if it weren’t for the infamous SF fog you’d be able to see the city, alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and so on. I walked around, took pictures, enjoyed the beauty, sat and read. Staring out at the bay with the wind blasting away I suddenly remembered sitting on that pier in Charleston and thinking that I must always live by the water. I stared out and I thought, “How could anyone possibly be unhappy amongst this?” It was a glorious feeling. While I was sitting and reading a few young French people came by and tried to play frisbee. They weren’t very good at it but I rather enjoyed listening to them. I fantasized about them asking me to play and responding to them in French. There was an older man wind skateboarding—something I had never seen before, and the pure joy on his face was contagious. I kept grinning every time he passed by.</p>

    <p>The other morning I read this <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/">article</a>, and for some reason I just instantly felt a little better about life. Maybe I just needed a reminder of some of those things. I had a pretty good weekend overall. My cousin totally kicked my ass at the gym and I’m still hurting from the workout she put me through. Most things are now moved into my new apartment and I’ll be moving the big things over tomorrow. I was really sad that my favorite mug broke and my biggest one, which is the one that PJ gave me for summer solstice a couple years ago, but I guess it just means I’ll have to find some new awesome mugs, right? I’ve got a new bed, new desk, new tv stand, new kitchen table and chairs…and hopefully a new life. I was invited to a barbecue on the 4th of July at the house of a couple people who were in The Producers and I went because I had nothing else to do. It was the first time I’ve had something to do for Independence Day in many years. I ended up being there for 9 hours and not even realizing it. The time just flew by; I had a blast. I really wasn’t expecting that at all. I was just enjoying myself the whole time, and eating great food (including my cherry pie and pecan pie). Some guy interrupted conversation at one point to say, “I’m sorry but can I just stop to point out how awesome it is that you look like a modern day Belle,” and I thanked him since I love Belle but I really wasn’t completely sure why he said that until a little later when I remembered that I was wearing a blue ribbon in my hair and my hairdo was just like Belle’s :-)</p>

    <p>So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it’s been 4 1/2 years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn’t believe I’ve been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it’s pretty exciting moving into a place that I’ll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.</p>

    <p>I don’t know how some people slip in and out of different languages so easily. I keep mixing french into my spanish, and I’m so frustrated by it. I mean, I know that my experience with french has made it foremost in my brain and all, but what if I get used to using spanish and then start slipping spanish into my french? Maybe my brain can’t handle multiple languages. I just want it to be neat and compartmentalized, ready to call forth at will. Maybe it’s because I have trouble thinking before I speak. I mean, it’s not like I don’t know what the correct word is for both, it’s that my brain doesn’t always choose the correct one first. I watch bilingual and multilingual people every day and think that it can’t be that hard when so many people are doing it. Maybe I’m too hard on myself. I usually am.</p>

    <p>I worked out today for the first time in a month. It was a kickass workout. Not only do I always feel great afterwards but it is also very therapeutic, turning aggression into productivity. My mind tends to wander when I’m exercising, and the angrier I got the harder I found myself working. I was also feeling really motivated because I simply do not look like my 21 year old self. I had a bangin’ body at 21 and now I’m 25 and the unfortunate decline has set in, and I’m already experiencing the effects of that in my love life. Men choosing the new models; it’s disgusting. Not that I really want a love life, but I just don’t feel good about my self and my body any more, and I want to again. Not to mention I need to get my endorphins from somewhere.</p>

    <p>My little sister is one of the most amazing people I’ve met in my life. I went from one end of the United States all the way to the other to share the joy of her high school graduation. I wanted to be there when she walked through that door into the big scary world out there. Katie is pure and beautiful in ways I just don’t see in anyone else. I hope the world doesn’t tear that out of her. I wish I could stay by her side and protect her from all harm in the world but if we never knew pain, would we ever know happiness? I know she’ll do amazing things. I’m already proud of the person she is and excited over the person she’ll become.</p>

    <p>I’m feeling very handicapped by my inability to produce the simplistic website index that I designed. You just simply can’t do anything with basic html these days. I knew that; that’s why I’ve stayed out of the game. Now I try and jump back in after all these years head first and am frustrated when I hit my head on a rock. I know that I can probably figure out the little I need to know by doing some reading up on the interwebs but am suffering from little personal time and sketchy internet. I certainly need to get myself focused on this project though to take my mind off of life’s tragedies.</p>
