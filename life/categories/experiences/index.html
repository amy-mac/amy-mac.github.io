      <p>During Jesse&rsquo;s Spring Break we took a trip to Virginia for a number of reasons. My little sister Katie graduated college this May and we weren&rsquo;t going to be able to go out there due to Jesse&rsquo;s teaching duties, but I still wanted to pay her a visit. Originally Jesse couldn&rsquo;t imagine why he&rsquo;d ever want to go to Virginia, but when he found out that Monticello is in the very town that Katie goes to college, he became interested. The trip then evolved into one that would satisfy Jesse&rsquo;s history interests while I got to enjoy being in an area I loved, and used to live in, as well as see some of my good friends. I assured Jesse that the area was full of history but it wasn&rsquo;t until we were there that he connected geographically exactly where it was I had lived. Needless to say, he was pleased and excited.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been working at Coupa for a full month now. I like it. I feel comfortable there in a way I haven&rsquo;t felt since I worked for the Shining Stars Foundation in the glory days. I&rsquo;ve lost track of the number of contributions I&rsquo;ve made now. It isn&rsquo;t all that glamourous and sometimes my eyes glaze over from a full day of doing nothing but reading code, but I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

      <p>There wasn&rsquo;t much discussion of where we&rsquo;d be going for our Honeymoon. Scotland was the natural choice. I had never been the UK, and had always wanted to visit it, and Jesse was keen on introducing his new bride to his heritage. So as soon as we got engaged I set out planning and researching for the honeymoon and along the way have grown increasingly fascinated by Scotland&rsquo;s history. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of our trip:</p>

      <p>The other night I was at a dinner party where they had 90&rsquo;s music playing through Pandora. I was loving the music, because I love reliving the 90&rsquo;s on a regular basis, and a song came on that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard in many years. I was sitting there subconsciously singing along—I knew every word—and that&rsquo;s when it hit me that I hadn&rsquo;t heard it in so long. I had to think about what the name of the song was and then I wondered <em>why</em> I hadn&rsquo;t heard it in so long, because darnit I love this song. I had it on a cassette tape and that was how I used to listen to it so much. I can&rsquo;t listen to my cassette tapes anymore because my biological mother stole my last CD/Tape player 9 years ago. 9 years I haven&rsquo;t been able to listen to my cassette tapes, but I still have them.</p>

  I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.

  In this dirty minded world you are either somebody’s wife or somebody’s whore—or fast on your way to becoming one or the other. I wanted a job and I wanted to live alone.

      <p>I’ve reached a point in my life where I know very much want I want but I am struggling to find and obtain it. It’s frustrating and sometimes makes me start to despair. I am just hoping that once I do get my hands on it that it really does make life just that much better. Here’s to hoping and continuing the pursuit.</p>

      <p>A lot has been going on over the last month. I just got back from a 3 week business trip to Colorado for the <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/our-programs/aspen-winter-games/">Aspen Winter Games</a>. It was once again a big success, and my big project, as usual, was creating the slideshow for the banquet. Every year I am faced with the challenge of creating it on a time crunch with limited resources, but every year I get countless compliments on it, so I suppose I must be doing something right. Once I finish compressing the video I will be posting it online if anyone is interested in it. Past years can be found <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/media/winter-games-slideshows/">here</a>. One thing that really stood out to me was how much I really enjoyed getting a chance to work with video again. It made me long to pursue a career in video editing again, though I know it&rsquo;s not likely or practical. However, this is the first year that I was chosen to edit the entire Winter Games souvenir video that will be sent to all the kids, families, and volunteers, and I&rsquo;m really excited about the project.</p>

Obviously the Care Bears were on to something! I bought myself an iPhone and am absolutely in love with it. I&rsquo;ve been tracking my mood since the beginning of the year with an app.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s hard to plan out my work schedule over the next few months with so much of my life up in the air right now. It&rsquo;s also nearing the time that I will need to start applying to new jobs. I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to look for a high-paying job, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s in my career field or not, because the sooner I get out the debt, the sooner I can do all the things that I really want to do; which includes even more education.</p>

      <p>I think I&rsquo;m going to take down my portfolio page until I have some time to complete it, because what&rsquo;s there right now is not only such a small portion of my portfolio, but it&rsquo;s really a bad representation of my art as a whole, that I don&rsquo;t want anyone thinking that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. Part of what actually was holding me back from taking the time to complete it in the first place was wondering if there was even a point in taking the time. Lately I&rsquo;ve been worried that I have my ladder against the wrong wall—to use a term from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>—and was striving to figure some of that out before expending the effort. I&rsquo;m considering sticking it out in the field of design and maybe not pursuing video editing. Strangely enough though, I&rsquo;m trying to get back into motion graphics. There&rsquo;s more of a need for that, as evidenced by Tomás telling me he could get me a job in a heartbeat if I was good with AfterEffects. Of course, if he had it his way my next career would be as a breeder <em>smirk</em>. I&rsquo;m just kidding, he&rsquo;s extremely supportive of my career interests and goals, he just wants babies at the same time.</p>

      <p>I went to a theatre festival on Sunday and though I enjoyed getting out of the house and the beauty of the Yerba Buena Gardens, I was a little disappointed with most of the acts I saw. I suppose I was just choosing the wrong performances to see. The highest quality one was probably <em>Jerry Springer: The Opera</em>, though I am not a fan of Jerry Springer the show. I also understand what Ron meant now when he said the show is not for the faint of heart. I was pretty wide eyed through most of their snippet.</p>

      <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation&rsquo;s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I&rsquo;m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year&rsquo;s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It&rsquo;s quite beautiful up there and I&rsquo;ll have to make the trip again when I&rsquo;m not stressing out and there&rsquo;s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

      <p>Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I&rsquo;m usually the first to admit that I&rsquo;m too proud, I&rsquo;m a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; and then I felt bad and guilty. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.</p>

      <p>I went to this completely amazing park last weekend in Berkeley. It&rsquo;s right on the bay, and if it weren&rsquo;t for the infamous SF fog you&rsquo;d be able to see the city, alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and so on. I walked around, took pictures, enjoyed the beauty, sat and read. Staring out at the bay with the wind blasting away I suddenly remembered sitting on that pier in Charleston and thinking that I must always live by the water. I stared out and I thought, &ldquo;How could anyone possibly be unhappy amongst this?&rdquo; It was a glorious feeling. While I was sitting and reading a few young French people came by and tried to play frisbee. They weren&rsquo;t very good at it but I rather enjoyed listening to them. I fantasized about them asking me to play and responding to them in French. There was an older man wind skateboarding&mdash;something I had never seen before, and the pure joy on his face was contagious. I kept grinning every time he passed by.</p>

      <p>The other morning I read this <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/">article</a>, and for some reason I just instantly felt a little better about life. Maybe I just needed a reminder of some of those things. I had a pretty good weekend overall. My cousin totally kicked my ass at the gym and I&rsquo;m still hurting from the workout she put me through. Most things are now moved into my new apartment and I&rsquo;ll be moving the big things over tomorrow. I was really sad that my favorite mug broke and my biggest one, which is the one that PJ gave me for summer solstice a couple years ago, but I guess it just means I&rsquo;ll have to find some new awesome mugs, right? I&rsquo;ve got a new bed, new desk, new tv stand, new kitchen table and chairs&hellip;and hopefully a new life. I was invited to a barbecue on the 4th of July at the house of a couple people who were in The Producers and I went because I had nothing else to do. It was the first time I&rsquo;ve had something to do for Independence Day in many years. I ended up being there for 9 hours and not even realizing it. The time just flew by; I had a blast. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting that at all. I was just enjoying myself the whole time, and eating great food (including my cherry pie and pecan pie). Some guy interrupted conversation at one point to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but can I just stop to point out how awesome it is that you look like a modern day Belle,&rdquo; and I thanked him since I love Belle but I really wasn&rsquo;t completely sure why he said that until a little later when I remembered that I was wearing a blue ribbon in my hair and my hairdo was just like Belle&rsquo;s :-)</p>

      <p>So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it&rsquo;s been 4 &frac12; years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it&rsquo;s pretty exciting moving into a place that I&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.</p>

      <p>My little sister is one of the most amazing people I&rsquo;ve met in my life. I went from one end of the United States all the way to the other to share the joy of her high school graduation. I wanted to be there when she walked through that door into the big scary world out there. Katie is pure and beautiful in ways I just don&rsquo;t see in anyone else. I hope the world doesn&rsquo;t tear that out of her. I wish I could stay by her side and protect her from all harm in the world but if we never knew pain, would we ever know happiness? I know she&rsquo;ll do amazing things. I&rsquo;m already proud of the person she is and excited over the person she&rsquo;ll become.</p>
