      <p>Talk about extreme neglect of my website. I never even finished my &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; that I do at the end of every year. Trying to do it as a blog this year instead of an electronic newsletter made it too long and overwhelming until I abandoned it completely. I&rsquo;ve hardly been online these past few months, and while the reasons are mostly happy ones, I do wish I had more time for my side projects, such as this website. For a while I was trying to keep this blog less personal and more about things other people might be interested in, but I suppose that&rsquo;s what twitter is for and in the end this is my space to do with it what I will. As such, I&rsquo;m tempted to go back to talking about what&rsquo;s going on in my life, there for whomever might be interested in knowing. I&rsquo;m not doing anyone any great injustice since my &ldquo;interesting/professional&rdquo; posts weren&rsquo;t happening anyway. So here&rsquo;s a summary of where I am right now:</p>

      <p>A lot has been going on over the last month. I just got back from a 3 week business trip to Colorado for the <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/our-programs/aspen-winter-games/">Aspen Winter Games</a>. It was once again a big success, and my big project, as usual, was creating the slideshow for the banquet. Every year I am faced with the challenge of creating it on a time crunch with limited resources, but every year I get countless compliments on it, so I suppose I must be doing something right. Once I finish compressing the video I will be posting it online if anyone is interested in it. Past years can be found <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/media/winter-games-slideshows/">here</a>. One thing that really stood out to me was how much I really enjoyed getting a chance to work with video again. It made me long to pursue a career in video editing again, though I know it&rsquo;s not likely or practical. However, this is the first year that I was chosen to edit the entire Winter Games souvenir video that will be sent to all the kids, families, and volunteers, and I&rsquo;m really excited about the project.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m starting to realize that the older I get, the less likely it is that I will find someone worthwhile to share my life with, because they will already be taken by other people. I wish I could go back to not caring about relationships or wanting one, but I&rsquo;ve realized how much more rewarding and amazing life can be with one. I don&rsquo;t want to have a child alone anymore; I want to share that experience with someone else. Everyone always says don&rsquo;t settle, and I haven&rsquo;t since my first relationship, but that means I may be alone forever. Maybe it&rsquo;s less important to find someone I can love, than it is to find someone who&rsquo;ll love me. I suppose I should start by leaving my house, right? /smirk</p>

      <p>It is now been a week since I had my epiphany on New Year&rsquo;s Eve while zoning out during the Pomplamoose set at the Dresden Dolls concert, and it&rsquo;s been the first week in a very long time that I&rsquo;ve consistently felt this good about myself and my life. Obviously the Care Bears were on to something! I bought myself an iPhone and am absolutely in love with it. I&rsquo;ve been tracking my mood since the beginning of the year with an app.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s hard to plan out my work schedule over the next few months with so much of my life up in the air right now. It&rsquo;s also nearing the time that I will need to start applying to new jobs. I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to look for a high-paying job, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s in my career field or not, because the sooner I get out the debt, the sooner I can do all the things that I really want to do; which includes even more education.</p>

      <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation&rsquo;s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I&rsquo;m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year&rsquo;s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It&rsquo;s quite beautiful up there and I&rsquo;ll have to make the trip again when I&rsquo;m not stressing out and there&rsquo;s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

      <p>The other morning I read this <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/">article</a>, and for some reason I just instantly felt a little better about life. Maybe I just needed a reminder of some of those things. I had a pretty good weekend overall. My cousin totally kicked my ass at the gym and I&rsquo;m still hurting from the workout she put me through. Most things are now moved into my new apartment and I&rsquo;ll be moving the big things over tomorrow. I was really sad that my favorite mug broke and my biggest one, which is the one that PJ gave me for summer solstice a couple years ago, but I guess it just means I&rsquo;ll have to find some new awesome mugs, right? I&rsquo;ve got a new bed, new desk, new tv stand, new kitchen table and chairs&hellip;and hopefully a new life. I was invited to a barbecue on the 4th of July at the house of a couple people who were in The Producers and I went because I had nothing else to do. It was the first time I&rsquo;ve had something to do for Independence Day in many years. I ended up being there for 9 hours and not even realizing it. The time just flew by; I had a blast. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting that at all. I was just enjoying myself the whole time, and eating great food (including my cherry pie and pecan pie). Some guy interrupted conversation at one point to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but can I just stop to point out how awesome it is that you look like a modern day Belle,&rdquo; and I thanked him since I love Belle but I really wasn&rsquo;t completely sure why he said that until a little later when I remembered that I was wearing a blue ribbon in my hair and my hairdo was just like Belle&rsquo;s :-)</p>

      <p>I worked out today for the first time in a month. It was a kickass workout. Not only do I always feel great afterwards but it is also very therapeutic, turning aggression into productivity. My mind tends to wander when I&rsquo;m exercising, and the angrier I got the harder I found myself working. I was also feeling really motivated because I simply do not look like my 21 year old self. I had a bangin&rsquo; body at 21 and now I&rsquo;m 25 and the unfortunate decline has set in, and I&rsquo;m already experiencing the effects of that in my love life. Men choosing the new models; it&rsquo;s disgusting. Not that I really want a love life, but I just don&rsquo;t feel good about my self and my body any more, and I want to again. Not to mention I need to get my endorphins from somewhere.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m feeling very handicapped by my inability to produce the simplistic website index that I designed. You just simply can&rsquo;t do anything with basic html these days. I knew that; that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve stayed out of the game. Now I try and jump back in after all these years head first and am frustrated when I hit my head on a rock. I know that I can probably figure out the little I need to know by doing some reading up on the interwebs but am suffering from little personal time and sketchy internet. I certainly need to get myself focused on this project though to take my mind off of life&rsquo;s tragedies.</p>

      <p>Now that I&rsquo;m feeling so motivated I had a harder time focusing at work today; all I wanted to do was work on the new website. I haven&rsquo;t been taking a lot of time for myself lately, but I&rsquo;ll be able to take more time off on my trip because of it. I&rsquo;m just so anxious to get started on so many things.</p>
