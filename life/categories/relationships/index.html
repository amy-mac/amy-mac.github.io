      <p>Last June I lost a good friend whom I valued greatly due to an overprotective husband and miscommunication. Honestly I still haven’t gotten over it and dream about her still. I try to keep myself from thinking about the situation because it really upsets me but I can’t do anything about it but move on with my life.</p>

      <p>As I was putting on my Sailor Moon shirt this morning I remembered my Aunt telling me a few years ago that no one would ever want to date me unless I stopped wearing &ldquo;little kid&rdquo; shirts. Thank goodness that I didn&rsquo;t listen to her, or else I might not have caught the attention of a kindred spirit, to whom I&rsquo;m now married, and happier than I ever thought I could be.</p>

      <p>There wasn&rsquo;t much discussion of where we&rsquo;d be going for our Honeymoon. Scotland was the natural choice. I had never been the UK, and had always wanted to visit it, and Jesse was keen on introducing his new bride to his heritage. So as soon as we got engaged I set out planning and researching for the honeymoon and along the way have grown increasingly fascinated by Scotland&rsquo;s history. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of our trip:</p>

      <p>Last night I showed <em>Working</em> (the musical) to Jesse. It was the first time I&rsquo;d watched it in a couple years and as I watched these people I used to know, I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking, once again, about how sad it is that really close friendships can go away over night or you just get fed up eventually. Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking that if you get to know anyone well enough, that they&rsquo;re bound to disappoint you at some point. I suppose that&rsquo;s very pessimistic, but it&rsquo;s been true in my life. It made me think, maybe everyone does bad things and if you don&rsquo;t know the dark parts of someone, then things go along fine, but once you know the truth then it doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m starting to realize that the older I get, the less likely it is that I will find someone worthwhile to share my life with, because they will already be taken by other people. I wish I could go back to not caring about relationships or wanting one, but I&rsquo;ve realized how much more rewarding and amazing life can be with one. I don&rsquo;t want to have a child alone anymore; I want to share that experience with someone else. Everyone always says don&rsquo;t settle, and I haven&rsquo;t since my first relationship, but that means I may be alone forever. Maybe it&rsquo;s less important to find someone I can love, than it is to find someone who&rsquo;ll love me. I suppose I should start by leaving my house, right? /smirk</p>

      <p>I think I&rsquo;m going to take down my portfolio page until I have some time to complete it, because what&rsquo;s there right now is not only such a small portion of my portfolio, but it&rsquo;s really a bad representation of my art as a whole, that I don&rsquo;t want anyone thinking that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. Part of what actually was holding me back from taking the time to complete it in the first place was wondering if there was even a point in taking the time. Lately I&rsquo;ve been worried that I have my ladder against the wrong wall—to use a term from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>—and was striving to figure some of that out before expending the effort. I&rsquo;m considering sticking it out in the field of design and maybe not pursuing video editing. Strangely enough though, I&rsquo;m trying to get back into motion graphics. There&rsquo;s more of a need for that, as evidenced by Tomás telling me he could get me a job in a heartbeat if I was good with AfterEffects. Of course, if he had it his way my next career would be as a breeder <em>smirk</em>. I&rsquo;m just kidding, he&rsquo;s extremely supportive of my career interests and goals, he just wants babies at the same time.</p>

      <p>I think if it weren&rsquo;t for being able to talk to PJ about my life and problems that I would probably go stark raving mad. I always feel so happy and good after talking to him and I think it&rsquo;s because of the release of stress I get just getting to talk to someone who understands.</p>

      <p>Once again I find myself wondering how I get myself into these situations. I&rsquo;m tearing out my hair in frustration; can&rsquo;t focus because I&rsquo;m tired and depressed, which also makes me feel stressed out. Why can&rsquo;t I just be normal?&ndash;a thought I&rsquo;ve wondered countless times in my life. I forced myself to go out of my comfort zone and now I just feel tangled and ensnared with no idea how to make things right. I&rsquo;m really angry with myself that I let this happen; I deserve the remorse that this situation will bring.</p>

      <p>So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it&rsquo;s been 4 &frac12; years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it&rsquo;s pretty exciting moving into a place that I&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.</p>
