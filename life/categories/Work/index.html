      <p>Talk about extreme neglect of my website. I never even finished my “year in review” that I do at the end of every year. Trying to do it as a blog this year instead of an electronic newsletter made it too long and overwhelming until I abandoned it completely. I’ve hardly been online these past few months, and while the reasons are mostly happy ones, I do wish I had more time for my side projects, such as this website. For a while I was trying to keep this blog less personal and more about things other people might be interested in, but I suppose that’s what twitter is for and in the end this is my space to do with it what I will. As such, I’m tempted to go back to talking about what’s going on in my life, there for whomever might be interested in knowing. I’m not doing anyone any great injustice since my “interesting/professional” posts weren’t happening anyway. So here’s a summary of where I am right now:</p>

      <p>A lot has been going on over the last month. I just got back from a 3 week business trip to Colorado for the <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/our-programs/aspen-winter-games/">Aspen Winter Games</a>. It was once again a big success, and my big project, as usual, was creating the slideshow for the banquet. Every year I am faced with the challenge of creating it on a time crunch with limited resources, but every year I get countless compliments on it, so I suppose I must be doing something right. Once I finish compressing the video I will be posting it online if anyone is interested in it. Past years can be found <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/media/winter-games-slideshows/">here</a>. One thing that really stood out to me was how much I really enjoyed getting a chance to work with video again. It made me long to pursue a career in video editing again, though I know it’s not likely or practical. However, this is the first year that I was chosen to edit the entire Winter Games souvenir video that will be sent to all the kids, families, and volunteers, and I’m really excited about the project.</p>

      <p>I’m starting to realize that the older I get, the less likely it is that I will find someone worthwhile to share my life with, because they will already be taken by other people. I wish I could go back to not caring about relationships or wanting one, but I’ve realized how much more rewarding and amazing life can be with one. I don’t want to have a child alone anymore; I want to share that experience with someone else. Everyone always says don’t settle, and I haven’t since my first relationship, but that means I may be alone forever. Maybe it’s less important to find someone I can love, than it is to find someone who’ll love me. I suppose I should start by leaving my house, right? /smirk</p>

      <p>It is now been a week since I had my epiphany on New Year’s Eve while zoning out during the Pomplamoose set at the Dresden Dolls concert, and it’s been the first week in a very long time that I’ve consistently felt this good about myself and my life. Obviously the Care Bears were on to something! I bought myself an iPhone and am absolutely in love with it. I’ve been tracking my mood since the beginning of the year with an app.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to plan out my work schedule over the next few months with so much of my life up in the air right now. It’s also nearing the time that I will need to start applying to new jobs. I’ve decided that I’m going to look for a high-paying job, regardless of whether it’s in my career field or not, because the sooner I get out the debt, the sooner I can do all the things that I really want to do; which includes even more education.</p>

      <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation’s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I’m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year’s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It’s quite beautiful up there and I’ll have to make the trip again when I’m not stressing out and there’s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

      <p>The other morning I read this <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/">article</a>, and for some reason I just instantly felt a little better about life. Maybe I just needed a reminder of some of those things. I had a pretty good weekend overall. My cousin totally kicked my ass at the gym and I’m still hurting from the workout she put me through. Most things are now moved into my new apartment and I’ll be moving the big things over tomorrow. I was really sad that my favorite mug broke and my biggest one, which is the one that PJ gave me for summer solstice a couple years ago, but I guess it just means I’ll have to find some new awesome mugs, right? I’ve got a new bed, new desk, new tv stand, new kitchen table and chairs…and hopefully a new life. I was invited to a barbecue on the 4th of July at the house of a couple people who were in The Producers and I went because I had nothing else to do. It was the first time I’ve had something to do for Independence Day in many years. I ended up being there for 9 hours and not even realizing it. The time just flew by; I had a blast. I really wasn’t expecting that at all. I was just enjoying myself the whole time, and eating great food (including my cherry pie and pecan pie). Some guy interrupted conversation at one point to say, “I’m sorry but can I just stop to point out how awesome it is that you look like a modern day Belle,” and I thanked him since I love Belle but I really wasn’t completely sure why he said that until a little later when I remembered that I was wearing a blue ribbon in my hair and my hairdo was just like Belle’s :-)</p>

      <p>I worked out today for the first time in a month. It was a kickass workout. Not only do I always feel great afterwards but it is also very therapeutic, turning aggression into productivity. My mind tends to wander when I’m exercising, and the angrier I got the harder I found myself working. I was also feeling really motivated because I simply do not look like my 21 year old self. I had a bangin’ body at 21 and now I’m 25 and the unfortunate decline has set in, and I’m already experiencing the effects of that in my love life. Men choosing the new models; it’s disgusting. Not that I really want a love life, but I just don’t feel good about my self and my body any more, and I want to again. Not to mention I need to get my endorphins from somewhere.</p>

      <p>I’m feeling very handicapped by my inability to produce the simplistic website index that I designed. You just simply can’t do anything with basic html these days. I knew that; that’s why I’ve stayed out of the game. Now I try and jump back in after all these years head first and am frustrated when I hit my head on a rock. I know that I can probably figure out the little I need to know by doing some reading up on the interwebs but am suffering from little personal time and sketchy internet. I certainly need to get myself focused on this project though to take my mind off of life’s tragedies.</p>

      <p>Now that I’m feeling so motivated I had a harder time focusing at work today; all I wanted to do was work on the new website. I haven’t been taking a lot of time for myself lately, but I’ll be able to take more time off on my trip because of it. I’m just so anxious to get started on so many things.</p>
