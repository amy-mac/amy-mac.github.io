      <p>Earlier this year I posted a Facebook status about how I realized that the source of my discontent was that on any given day I felt like I should be doing something extraordinary. A few people laughed and said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you learn anything from Pippin?&rdquo; For those of you who are unfamiliar with the musical, here is a summary:</p>

      <p>Someday I want to know what it feels like to have someone be crazy about me, or does that really only happen in the movies? I know things are always better in the books and in the movies, but can&rsquo;t it be possible for someone to adore me? I&rsquo;ve adored other people but never had it returned.</p>

      <p>I think I&rsquo;m going to take down my portfolio page until I have some time to complete it, because what&rsquo;s there right now is not only such a small portion of my portfolio, but it&rsquo;s really a bad representation of my art as a whole, that I don&rsquo;t want anyone thinking that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. Part of what actually was holding me back from taking the time to complete it in the first place was wondering if there was even a point in taking the time. Lately I&rsquo;ve been worried that I have my ladder against the wrong wall—to use a term from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>—and was striving to figure some of that out before expending the effort. I&rsquo;m considering sticking it out in the field of design and maybe not pursuing video editing. Strangely enough though, I&rsquo;m trying to get back into motion graphics. There&rsquo;s more of a need for that, as evidenced by Tomás telling me he could get me a job in a heartbeat if I was good with AfterEffects. Of course, if he had it his way my next career would be as a breeder <em>smirk</em>. I&rsquo;m just kidding, he&rsquo;s extremely supportive of my career interests and goals, he just wants babies at the same time.</p>

      <p>I think if it weren&rsquo;t for being able to talk to PJ about my life and problems that I would probably go stark raving mad. I always feel so happy and good after talking to him and I think it&rsquo;s because of the release of stress I get just getting to talk to someone who understands.</p>

      <p>I was cast in <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em> as Featured Dancer/Ensemble. When rehearsals start I will find out whether I was cast in the role I read for at callbacks. I really hope I am, as it will allow me to put a french accent to use and then I can say that my french classes in school weren&rsquo;t worthless. I think doing a show will be really good for me right now. It&rsquo;ll keep me busy and active, and who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll make some friends.</p>

      <p>How much life has changed since I&rsquo;ve last written. I keep wanting to write but haven&rsquo;t found the opportunity to with everything going on. So much thought and decisions have arisen surrounding my life and goals and where I&rsquo;m going with everything.

      <p>I went to a theatre festival on Sunday and though I enjoyed getting out of the house and the beauty of the Yerba Buena Gardens, I was a little disappointed with most of the acts I saw. I suppose I was just choosing the wrong performances to see. The highest quality one was probably <em>Jerry Springer: The Opera</em>, though I am not a fan of Jerry Springer the show. I also understand what Ron meant now when he said the show is not for the faint of heart. I was pretty wide eyed through most of their snippet.</p>

      <p>I always look at the things I want to pass onto my children and the talents that I have to offer them and think that my children are going to think I&rsquo;m really neat, but today it occurred to me that as someone who grew up without parents and therefore nothing to think was really neat about my parents, do children really think that way, or do they just take it for granted? Is my child going to not care or value the fact that I&rsquo;m an artist, or that I sing, dance, and perform? Will they shrug that I play piano for them, or that I pass on to them a crazy amount of books to fuel their knowledge and curiosity of life?</p>

      <p>Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I&rsquo;m usually the first to admit that I&rsquo;m too proud, I&rsquo;m a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; and then I felt bad and guilty. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.</p>

      <p>So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it&rsquo;s been 4 &frac12; years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it&rsquo;s pretty exciting moving into a place that I&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.</p>

      <p>I worked out today for the first time in a month. It was a kickass workout. Not only do I always feel great afterwards but it is also very therapeutic, turning aggression into productivity. My mind tends to wander when I&rsquo;m exercising, and the angrier I got the harder I found myself working. I was also feeling really motivated because I simply do not look like my 21 year old self. I had a bangin&rsquo; body at 21 and now I&rsquo;m 25 and the unfortunate decline has set in, and I&rsquo;m already experiencing the effects of that in my love life. Men choosing the new models; it&rsquo;s disgusting. Not that I really want a love life, but I just don&rsquo;t feel good about my self and my body any more, and I want to again. Not to mention I need to get my endorphins from somewhere.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m really excited about where I am with my life right now, and am feeling really motivated to do the things I keep putting off; for example the self promoting website I&rsquo;ve been trying to do for almost a year now. So here we are. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get into a routine of getting work done on this on a regular basis.</p>
