      <p>I&rsquo;ve been working at Coupa for a full month now. I like it. I feel comfortable there in a way I haven&rsquo;t felt since I worked for the Shining Stars Foundation in the glory days. I&rsquo;ve lost track of the number of contributions I&rsquo;ve made now. It isn&rsquo;t all that glamourous and sometimes my eyes glaze over from a full day of doing nothing but reading code, but I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

      <p>The first show we were going to see in Ashland was <em>Cymbeline</em> in the Elizabethan Theater (which is an outdoor theater) but due to the wildfires and thick smoke they canceled the show, for the first time in the festival&rsquo;s history, due to health concerns. They continued to cancel all shows in that theater over the next few days and finally opened it up again just in time for the other show we were seeing in the Elizabethan. I&rsquo;m glad that we got to enjoy the Elizabethan at all, under the circumstances, but I&rsquo;m totally bummed that we missed out on <em>Cymbeline</em>.</p>

      <p>For a while the excitement and passion had been stolen from me, but these last few weeks I’ve felt it increasingly coming back. People finally stopped asking me, “Are you doing any shows right now?” so I no longer had to deal with the awkwardness of saying such foreign words for me: “No. I haven’t been auditioning for anything; I’ve got other things going on right now,” and seeing the look of concern from those that know that theatre always took precedence.</p>

      <p>It is now been a week since I had my epiphany on New Year&rsquo;s Eve while zoning out during the Pomplamoose set at the Dresden Dolls concert, and it&rsquo;s been the first week in a very long time that I&rsquo;ve consistently felt this good about myself and my life. Obviously the Care Bears were on to something! I bought myself an iPhone and am absolutely in love with it. I&rsquo;ve been tracking my mood since the beginning of the year with an app.</p>

      <p>I was cast in <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em> as Featured Dancer/Ensemble. When rehearsals start I will find out whether I was cast in the role I read for at callbacks. I really hope I am, as it will allow me to put a french accent to use and then I can say that my french classes in school weren&rsquo;t worthless. I think doing a show will be really good for me right now. It&rsquo;ll keep me busy and active, and who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll make some friends.</p>

      <p>I think I have a few good monologues to choose from in <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> for my <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> audition. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to working through a straight acting piece; it&rsquo;s been WAY too many years. In fact, I&rsquo;m feeling a little rusty, and that worries me. I&rsquo;m going to be ushering a few shows next month, and that&rsquo;s really exciting. There&rsquo;s nothing like getting to see shows for free!</p>

      <p>I went to a theatre festival on Sunday and though I enjoyed getting out of the house and the beauty of the Yerba Buena Gardens, I was a little disappointed with most of the acts I saw. I suppose I was just choosing the wrong performances to see. The highest quality one was probably <em>Jerry Springer: The Opera</em>, though I am not a fan of Jerry Springer the show. I also understand what Ron meant now when he said the show is not for the faint of heart. I was pretty wide eyed through most of their snippet.</p>

      <p>Miraculously finding sheet music for <em>Little by Little</em> after all these years has given me a spurt of new hope for my Spelling Bee audition. I am on top of the world right now! It was completely worth the 10 bucks :-)</p>
