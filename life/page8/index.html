    <p>I went to a theatre festival on Sunday and though I enjoyed getting out of the house and the beauty of the Yerba Buena Gardens, I was a little disappointed with most of the acts I saw. I suppose I was just choosing the wrong performances to see. The highest quality one was probably <em>Jerry Springer: The Opera</em>, though I am not a fan of Jerry Springer the show. I also understand what Ron meant now when he said the show is not for the faint of heart. I was pretty wide eyed through most of their snippet.</p>

    <p>I always look at the things I want to pass onto my children and the talents that I have to offer them and think that my children are going to think I&rsquo;m really neat, but today it occurred to me that as someone who grew up without parents and therefore nothing to think was really neat about my parents, do children really think that way, or do they just take it for granted? Is my child going to not care or value the fact that I&rsquo;m an artist, or that I sing, dance, and perform? Will they shrug that I play piano for them, or that I pass on to them a crazy amount of books to fuel their knowledge and curiosity of life?</p>

    <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation&rsquo;s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I&rsquo;m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year&rsquo;s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It&rsquo;s quite beautiful up there and I&rsquo;ll have to make the trip again when I&rsquo;m not stressing out and there&rsquo;s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

    <p>Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I&rsquo;m usually the first to admit that I&rsquo;m too proud, I&rsquo;m a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; and then I felt bad and guilty. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.</p>

    <p>I went to this completely amazing park last weekend in Berkeley. It&rsquo;s right on the bay, and if it weren&rsquo;t for the infamous SF fog you&rsquo;d be able to see the city, alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and so on. I walked around, took pictures, enjoyed the beauty, sat and read. Staring out at the bay with the wind blasting away I suddenly remembered sitting on that pier in Charleston and thinking that I must always live by the water. I stared out and I thought, &ldquo;How could anyone possibly be unhappy amongst this?&rdquo; It was a glorious feeling. While I was sitting and reading a few young French people came by and tried to play frisbee. They weren&rsquo;t very good at it but I rather enjoyed listening to them. I fantasized about them asking me to play and responding to them in French. There was an older man wind skateboarding&mdash;something I had never seen before, and the pure joy on his face was contagious. I kept grinning every time he passed by.</p>
