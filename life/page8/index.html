    <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation&rsquo;s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I&rsquo;m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year&rsquo;s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It&rsquo;s quite beautiful up there and I&rsquo;ll have to make the trip again when I&rsquo;m not stressing out and there&rsquo;s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

    <p>Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I&rsquo;m usually the first to admit that I&rsquo;m too proud, I&rsquo;m a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; and then I felt bad and guilty. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.</p>

    <p>I went to this completely amazing park last weekend in Berkeley. It&rsquo;s right on the bay, and if it weren&rsquo;t for the infamous SF fog you&rsquo;d be able to see the city, alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and so on. I walked around, took pictures, enjoyed the beauty, sat and read. Staring out at the bay with the wind blasting away I suddenly remembered sitting on that pier in Charleston and thinking that I must always live by the water. I stared out and I thought, &ldquo;How could anyone possibly be unhappy amongst this?&rdquo; It was a glorious feeling. While I was sitting and reading a few young French people came by and tried to play frisbee. They weren&rsquo;t very good at it but I rather enjoyed listening to them. I fantasized about them asking me to play and responding to them in French. There was an older man wind skateboarding&mdash;something I had never seen before, and the pure joy on his face was contagious. I kept grinning every time he passed by.</p>

    <p>The other morning I read this <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/">article</a>, and for some reason I just instantly felt a little better about life. Maybe I just needed a reminder of some of those things. I had a pretty good weekend overall. My cousin totally kicked my ass at the gym and I&rsquo;m still hurting from the workout she put me through. Most things are now moved into my new apartment and I&rsquo;ll be moving the big things over tomorrow. I was really sad that my favorite mug broke and my biggest one, which is the one that PJ gave me for summer solstice a couple years ago, but I guess it just means I&rsquo;ll have to find some new awesome mugs, right? I&rsquo;ve got a new bed, new desk, new tv stand, new kitchen table and chairs&hellip;and hopefully a new life. I was invited to a barbecue on the 4th of July at the house of a couple people who were in The Producers and I went because I had nothing else to do. It was the first time I&rsquo;ve had something to do for Independence Day in many years. I ended up being there for 9 hours and not even realizing it. The time just flew by; I had a blast. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting that at all. I was just enjoying myself the whole time, and eating great food (including my cherry pie and pecan pie). Some guy interrupted conversation at one point to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but can I just stop to point out how awesome it is that you look like a modern day Belle,&rdquo; and I thanked him since I love Belle but I really wasn&rsquo;t completely sure why he said that until a little later when I remembered that I was wearing a blue ribbon in my hair and my hairdo was just like Belle&rsquo;s :-)</p>

    <p>So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it&rsquo;s been 4 &frac12; years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it&rsquo;s pretty exciting moving into a place that I&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.</p>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t know how some people slip in and out of different languages so easily. I keep mixing french into my spanish, and I&rsquo;m so frustrated by it. I mean, I know that my experience with french has made it foremost in my brain and all, but what if I get used to using spanish and then start slipping spanish into my french? Maybe my brain can&rsquo;t handle multiple languages. I just want it to be neat and compartmentalized, ready to call forth at will. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I have trouble thinking before I speak. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t know what the correct word is for both, it&rsquo;s that my brain doesn&rsquo;t always choose the correct one first. I watch bilingual and multilingual people every day and think that it can&rsquo;t be that hard when so many people are doing it. Maybe I&rsquo;m too hard on myself. I usually am.</p>

    <p>I worked out today for the first time in a month. It was a kickass workout. Not only do I always feel great afterwards but it is also very therapeutic, turning aggression into productivity. My mind tends to wander when I&rsquo;m exercising, and the angrier I got the harder I found myself working. I was also feeling really motivated because I simply do not look like my 21 year old self. I had a bangin&rsquo; body at 21 and now I&rsquo;m 25 and the unfortunate decline has set in, and I&rsquo;m already experiencing the effects of that in my love life. Men choosing the new models; it&rsquo;s disgusting. Not that I really want a love life, but I just don&rsquo;t feel good about my self and my body any more, and I want to again. Not to mention I need to get my endorphins from somewhere.</p>

    <p>My little sister is one of the most amazing people I&rsquo;ve met in my life. I went from one end of the United States all the way to the other to share the joy of her high school graduation. I wanted to be there when she walked through that door into the big scary world out there. Katie is pure and beautiful in ways I just don&rsquo;t see in anyone else. I hope the world doesn&rsquo;t tear that out of her. I wish I could stay by her side and protect her from all harm in the world but if we never knew pain, would we ever know happiness? I know she&rsquo;ll do amazing things. I&rsquo;m already proud of the person she is and excited over the person she&rsquo;ll become.</p>
