    <p>I think I have a few good monologues to choose from in <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> for my <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> audition. I’m really looking forward to working through a straight acting piece; it’s been WAY too many years. In fact, I’m feeling a little rusty, and that worries me. I’m going to be ushering a few shows next month, and that’s really exciting. There’s nothing like getting to see shows for free!</p>

    <p>I went to a theatre festival on Sunday and though I enjoyed getting out of the house and the beauty of the Yerba Buena Gardens, I was a little disappointed with most of the acts I saw. I suppose I was just choosing the wrong performances to see. The highest quality one was probably <em>Jerry Springer: The Opera</em>, though I am not a fan of Jerry Springer the show. I also understand what Ron meant now when he said the show is not for the faint of heart. I was pretty wide eyed through most of their snippet.</p>

    <p>I always look at the things I want to pass onto my children and the talents that I have to offer them and think that my children are going to think I’m really neat, but today it occurred to me that as someone who grew up without parents and therefore nothing to think was really neat about my parents, do children really think that way, or do they just take it for granted? Is my child going to not care or value the fact that I’m an artist, or that I sing, dance, and perform? Will they shrug that I play piano for them, or that I pass on to them a crazy amount of books to fuel their knowledge and curiosity of life?</p>

    <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation’s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I’m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year’s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It’s quite beautiful up there and I’ll have to make the trip again when I’m not stressing out and there’s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

    <p>Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I’m usually the first to admit that I’m too proud, I’m a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, “What’s wrong with you?” and then I felt bad and guilty. I don’t know what’s really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.</p>
