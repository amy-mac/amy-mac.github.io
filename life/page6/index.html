    <p>A lot has been going on over the last month. I just got back from a 3 week business trip to Colorado for the <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/our-programs/aspen-winter-games/">Aspen Winter Games</a>. It was once again a big success, and my big project, as usual, was creating the slideshow for the banquet. Every year I am faced with the challenge of creating it on a time crunch with limited resources, but every year I get countless compliments on it, so I suppose I must be doing something right. Once I finish compressing the video I will be posting it online if anyone is interested in it. Past years can be found <a href="http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/media/winter-games-slideshows/">here</a>. One thing that really stood out to me was how much I really enjoyed getting a chance to work with video again. It made me long to pursue a career in video editing again, though I know it&rsquo;s not likely or practical. However, this is the first year that I was chosen to edit the entire Winter Games souvenir video that will be sent to all the kids, families, and volunteers, and I&rsquo;m really excited about the project.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m starting to realize that the older I get, the less likely it is that I will find someone worthwhile to share my life with, because they will already be taken by other people. I wish I could go back to not caring about relationships or wanting one, but I&rsquo;ve realized how much more rewarding and amazing life can be with one. I don&rsquo;t want to have a child alone anymore; I want to share that experience with someone else. Everyone always says don&rsquo;t settle, and I haven&rsquo;t since my first relationship, but that means I may be alone forever. Maybe it&rsquo;s less important to find someone I can love, than it is to find someone who&rsquo;ll love me. I suppose I should start by leaving my house, right? /smirk</p>

    <p>It is now been a week since I had my epiphany on New Year&rsquo;s Eve while zoning out during the Pomplamoose set at the Dresden Dolls concert, and it&rsquo;s been the first week in a very long time that I&rsquo;ve consistently felt this good about myself and my life. Obviously the Care Bears were on to something! I bought myself an iPhone and am absolutely in love with it. I&rsquo;ve been tracking my mood since the beginning of the year with an app.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s hard to plan out my work schedule over the next few months with so much of my life up in the air right now. It&rsquo;s also nearing the time that I will need to start applying to new jobs. I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to look for a high-paying job, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s in my career field or not, because the sooner I get out the debt, the sooner I can do all the things that I really want to do; which includes even more education.</p>

    <p>I think I&rsquo;m going to take down my portfolio page until I have some time to complete it, because what&rsquo;s there right now is not only such a small portion of my portfolio, but it&rsquo;s really a bad representation of my art as a whole, that I don&rsquo;t want anyone thinking that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. Part of what actually was holding me back from taking the time to complete it in the first place was wondering if there was even a point in taking the time. Lately I&rsquo;ve been worried that I have my ladder against the wrong wall—to use a term from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>—and was striving to figure some of that out before expending the effort. I&rsquo;m considering sticking it out in the field of design and maybe not pursuing video editing. Strangely enough though, I&rsquo;m trying to get back into motion graphics. There&rsquo;s more of a need for that, as evidenced by Tomás telling me he could get me a job in a heartbeat if I was good with AfterEffects. Of course, if he had it his way my next career would be as a breeder <em>smirk</em>. I&rsquo;m just kidding, he&rsquo;s extremely supportive of my career interests and goals, he just wants babies at the same time.</p>
