<p>A list of the shows I saw at the <a href="http://www.osfashland.org/">Oregon Shakespeare Festival</a> and what I thought of them:</p>

<h2>As You Like It by William Shakespeare</h2>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen this play before, so I was going into it knowing only a little. I thought the story itself was a good story but agreed with my boyfriend that it rapidly wraps up too neatly at the end. I thought all the actors were great with the exception of the woman playing Rosalind. I did not find her to be very believable, bordering on not being that great of an actress. The group I was with agreed they also did not enjoy the Rosalind. One of my favorites was the jester, Touchstone. I really liked the actor playing him and thought the character one of the best in the show. The costumes were fantastic and the set simplistic but effective. The play was performed at the Elizabethan theater which was an incredible outdoor venue that mimics the Globe Theater. Overall it was magical and enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Romeo &amp; Juliet by William Shakespeare</h2>

<p>I admit that I was not keen on seeing yet another <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>, which might make me biased, but this was certainly the show I enjoyed the least out of everything we saw. This instance of it was set in the 1840&rsquo;s in California, in a spanish village; this modern setting was not actually a problem and was one of the okay things about the show. I would say I am more familiar with this play than any of Shakespeare&rsquo;s others, which is common for most people, as I have read it multiple times and seen countless versions of it live and on screen, and as it opened with that initial frolic/fighting between the house of Montague &amp; Capulet I was rolling my eyes at one of the over the top Montague actors and wondering if this is the type of performances I&rsquo;d have to sit through for the next 3 hours. I&rsquo;m happy to say that it did in fact get better once that actor was off the stage, but overall the show wasn&rsquo;t great which I blame in large part on the actress playing Juliet. I had seen her the night before as Phoebe in As You Like It, and she was good in that part; however, as Juliet she was only ever good for short moments here and there. At times she portrayed the youthful exuberance of a silly young girl in love very well, which is the only compliment I can give her. Half the time that she was speaking I felt like she had no idea what she was actually saying and was just reciting lines. With such bad acting and lack of emotional response it made her unbelievable as a character. I didn&rsquo;t believe her and I didn&rsquo;t care about her. This was only more emphasized by the actor playing Romeo being as good as he was; I had no complaints about him and thought he was great. But I was so bored by the ending scenes, because of a lack of caring that I was silently thinking about Juliet, &ldquo;Oh please just die already.&rdquo; The actor playing Mercutio was fabulous and accounted for the moments of the play that I enjoyed the most; I suppose once he died the play increasingly lost interest for me.</p>

<h2>Medea/Macbeth/Cinderella by Euripides, Shakespeare, and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, adapted by Bill Rauch &amp; Tracy Young</h2>

<p>This show was a passion project by the artistic director of the festival which combines the stories of <em>Medea</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, and <em>Cinderella</em> (as portrayed in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical). If this sounds ridiculous, you are indeed correct. I would recommend reading the summary and reasonings <a href="http://www.osfashland.org/browse/production.aspx?prod=237">here</a>. Though I had read the program&rsquo;s explanations beforehand, I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect, except for being excited when I discovered that it was <em>Rodgers and Hammerstein&rsquo;s Cinderella</em> they were doing, which meant there would be music. There is a lot to say about this show, being that it is three shows in one. It was an interesting concept and I did enjoy myself throughout the whole show, however I think it was entirely too busy, and with people talking over one another and singing over one another and so on, I think it is impossible to understand what it going on if you are not familiar with at least two of the shows. Luckily I am very familiar with <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>R&amp;H&rsquo;s Cinderella</em>, so I tried to concentrate more on the <em>Medea</em> sections when they were all three on stage, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t get lost with where they were in that story.</p>

<p>Everyone in the <em>Macbeth</em> story were actors, and everyone in the <em>Medea</em> story were actresses. I really loved this aspect of the show. The men playing the three witches (weird sisters) were wonderful and so much fun, and with the three shows interacting with each other, it was especially interesting when they&rsquo;d join the ballroom scenes of <em>Cinderella</em>. The man playing Lady Macbeth was really quite great also, as well as the woman playing Jason. All these characters were believable, regardless of their gender, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing this done more often. Towards the end of the show everyone in the cast was progressively stripping down their costumes &amp; makeup, till they were left at the very end barefaced and wearing simple black. I&rsquo;m not completely sure what the point of this was, but I thought it was fun to see what everyone looked like without the glamour of the stage.</p>

<p>The set was great, the lighting and effects were quite good, and everyone on stage was good. I still don&rsquo;t think this really works as a show, because of being way too busy, but I was glad that I saw it and wasn&rsquo;t bored for an instant.</p>

<h2>All the Way by Robert Schenkkan</h2>

<p>I admit I was not excited about this show and thought it would be boring but I&rsquo;m happy to say that I was wrong. This play is based on the year following the death of President John F. Kennedy and focuses on President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Civil Rights movement. They had an extremely effective set design that easily transformed from a courtroom, to Congress, to the oval office, and so on. Every actor/actress was believable but the man playing President Johnson was phenomenal. There were a lot of laughs in this play but I found it also invoking a sadness as I watched the ridiculous thoughts and process that still take place in the American government today. It was as if I was watching the same issues and debates that plague our current society and the same irrationality by those in power and frustration from the populace it affects. It certainly makes me wonder what issues we&rsquo;ll be demanding the government to fix 50 years from now, if the American government doesn&rsquo;t fall apart before then. This was Jesse&rsquo;s favorite play of the week, which isn&rsquo;t surprising as a history major, and he even bought the script afterwards.</p>

<h2>Troilus &amp; Cressida by William Shakespeare</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I never would have thought that I’d be seeing a Shakespeare play that incorporates music by the Bloodhound Gang. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fb&amp;src=hash">#fb</a></p>&mdash; Amy MacKinnon (@ThatAmyMac) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatAmyMac/statuses/234143038841180160">August 11, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I was not familiar with this play, though I am familiar with the <em>Illiad</em> et cetera, so it held a bit of intrigue to me as another aspect of the Trojan War. I ranted while we were heading in about how I don&rsquo;t understand why everyone has to modernize Shakespeare plays, and why can&rsquo;t they just do it as a period piece to appease all those who haven&rsquo;t seen the show before. Luckily this ended up not spoiling the show for me after all, as the modernization worked extremely well with this particular story. As stated in a tweet that night, I never thought I&rsquo;d be seeing a Shakespeare play that incorporates Bloodhound Gang music. The venue for this play is called &ldquo;The New Theater&rdquo; and is a small blackbox-ish theatre in the round. 10 minutes before the show started some of the actors started ambling in and going about their business, like they were just hanging around in a war camp. This was the point that they were playing some modern music and the actor playing Petropolis started dancing to The Bad Touch by the Bloodhound Gang before the actor playing Ajax pointed a gun at him. They then played Firewater Burn by the Bloodhound Gang which then opened the show with an explosion.</p>

<p>We were notified upon entering the theatre that the role of Cressida was going to be played by an understudy instead of the usual actress. Someone in my group commented negatively on this but I said, &ldquo;Hey sometimes the understudies are just as good, if not better.&rdquo; Unfortunately in this case I was wrong, and it put a damper on the whole show that the Cressida was not only very amateur in her acting skills but wasn&rsquo;t good at projecting either, so it was very hard to hear her most of the time&hellip;and we were in the 2nd row. I empathize with her and how hard it is to get up and perform a show that you aren&rsquo;t used to doing, but my entire group lamented that we were not able to see the usual Cressida. I really enjoyed all of the other actors, with a particularly good performances by the actor playing Pandarus.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint with the show is actually the fault of how the play itself is written, not with this performance of it. The show ends abruptly, and really doesn&rsquo;t have a conclusion. It ends at the top of the climax which really made it quite anti-climatic. I turned to Jesse and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? Where&rsquo;s the ending?&rdquo; It was so unsatisfying; you are left with so many questions. The set was simple, but great. Lighting was fantastic. With the exception of the Cressida, this should have felt like a phenomenal show afterwards, and yet that abrupt ending just made me feel so uneasy and left me with a bad impression. Boo Mr. Shakespeare. Someone else re-write this ending.</p>

<h2>Animal Crackers by George S. Kaufman &amp; Morrie Ryskind; Music &amp; Lyrics by Bert Kalmar &amp; Harry Ruby</h2>

<p>This was probably my favorite show that we saw while at the festival, due to it being the most all-around satisfying. It was a musical comedy/Marx brothers show and it was an absolute delight from start to finish. The set was fantastic and the costumes were great. The actors were all wonderful and had great voices, but in particular the guys playing the Marx brothers&#39; characters were incredible. I was laughing almost nonstop through the entire thing. It was just such unadulterated fun. Because of the improv nature of a Marx brothers show, some of the people I was with bought the script afterwards just to see what was actually in there and what wasn&rsquo;t. This is certainly the best kind of show to see live because of the synergy between the audience and the cast is what makes it as good as it is. As a performer, these are the kind of shows that get me excited about doing live theatre—the ones that either fill you with glee or break your heart.</p>

<h2>Henry V by William Shakespeare</h2>

<p>As a play I do not think that the story is all that interesting. <em>Henry V</em> does battle in France, then marries the French Princess Catherine. Yes, it&rsquo;s suppose to be the characters that make it interesting as they go through their struggles, and I did like the show, but I&rsquo;d say overall it would not be one I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing again because there&rsquo;s just not a lot to it. It did, however, get me thinking about <em>The Lion in Winter</em> and <em>Richard III</em> and wanting to understand better how all of these historical stories connect. I had been keeping all these stories as separate entities in my head and spent half the play trying to reconcile them on an actual timeline. Luckily my boyfriend is obsessed with history and I was able to question him at intermission as to when those other plays took place in relationship to <em>Henry V</em>. Afterwards, though I could hardly stay awake on the walk back to our place, I stayed up late reading countless wikipedia pages on my iPhone of just about every single monarch between Henry II and Queen Victoria. I now have a pretty good grasp of the timeline of the last 1,000 years of British rule. I was glad to get to see the Elizabethan theater again, and once again thought they did well with the set and costumes for the venue; everyone was good in their roles. It was a good last show to end our vacation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Overall the entire experience at the Festival was magical and made me want to come back again and again. I am already looking forward to next year&rsquo;s shows and hope to become a regular.</p>
