<p>Envision Captain Jean Luc Picard saying that, as it then makes it even more epic. As most of you already know, I am newly engaged. For the sake of the people who were not there and wanted to be, or do not use social media, I decided to say a few words about it.</p>

<p>Jesse’s family gets together for the combined birthdays of his cousin and him every year, so for a couple months we had this birthday party on the calendar for them. Nothing special, just a get-together at a park. I always make pies for the family events, so we were running a few minutes late waiting for it to finish baking. We ran out the door quickly with me continually stopping to grab things to prepare for the festivities, but him ushering me along. I wanted to do my hair nicely, just because I was in the mood to, but didn’t have time. I’ve continually been glad over the last week that I decided not to wear my “That’s what she said!” t-shirt. We were a few minutes late arriving to the park, and as we walked up to the picnic tables I almost immediately was overtaken by my Aunt Rhonda saying hi to me. For a few seconds I was very confused, a feeling I generally have more often these days with my lack of sleep. I exclaimed, “What are you doing here?” trying to rack my brain as to why my family would come even if Jesse had invited them, as I can never get them to my end of the bay. At some point someone took my things from me and then as I started to look around I realized that more people were there that I had not expected to see. I got even more confused and asked Jesse, “Why are all our friends here?”</p>

<p>It was then that he said, “Well Amy, I’ve been keeping something from you for the last couple months. This is not actually my birthday party. It is our engagement party.” There is actually a picture that perfectly captures my extreme mortification when I realized I was being proposed to in front of all these people. From then on the next moments were really all a blur, and so I can’t remember it in perfect detail. He got down on one knee and held out the ring to me. I wasn’t really sure what I was supposed to do, and then I heard his mother shout, “Well ask her!” I believe he then asked me, “Will you marry me?” but I honestly can’t remember that part. I just remember not knowing if I was supposed to take the ring out of the box, so I kept standing there feeling like an idiot, being embarrassed and confused. This is not to say that I don’t think it was all incredibly sweet and that I’m not happy. I was just very surprised, overwhelmed, and have trouble being the center of attention. I also am quite socially inept, and being that I haven’t been in this situated before was at a loss of what was expected of me. There are times when I wish real life has a script and director.</p>

<p>There was then lots of hugging, which was also a blur. Everyone wanted to see the ring, and I didn’t even get a good look at it myself until after things calmed down. It’s gorgeous, by the way. Over the past week I keep almost walking into doors as I stare at it’s sparkling glory. Blue is my favorite color so Jesse got me a sapphire. I don’t think the ring could be any more perfect. I also don’t think any of the pictures have done it justice, but isn’t that always the problem with beautiful things? There were lots of pictures and congratulations, and people kept commenting that I was shaking.</p>

<p>Jesse’s father caught the whole thing through his <a href="http://omtattoo.com/theProposal/">wonderful pictures</a> (he used to be a professional photographer) and I’m sure there are some embarrassing videos out there, judging from the people in the background, who I had no idea were there while the moment was happening. People kept asking me when the wedding would be and I said, “I don’t know, I’ve only known about this for 5 minutes!” I’m amazed and slightly annoyed that everyone has known this was going to happen but me. After things calmed down I was able to relax and enjoy myself hanging out with friends and family, and eating lots of great food, and also…CAKE.</p>

<p>That evening when we got home I was absolutely exhausted and on the verge of falling asleep, but I had to go to choir rehearsal. The day’s overwhelming interactions left me even more tired that usual and so it continued to be an exhausting week. Once we were home I asked Jesse to propose to me again since I couldn’t remember him asking me. It has been very surreal, and there has been an outpouring of love and celebrations which I had not anticipated. I’ve found myself very excited about planning our inevitably nerdy wedding. Life is starting to get back to normal now, with the exception of me having to remember to say fiancé instead of boyfriend, which is very difficult. I think I blush every time I say it, and it certainly doesn’t help when my coworkers go, “Awww.” I’m very happy, and can’t believe that someone I adore so completely wants to make me their wife. I can’t believe that I adore someone so completely that I want to be their wife. Anyone who knows me well enough knows what a big deal that last notion is.</p>

<p>This introverted wallflower has been put through the gauntlet this week, but I have many months to prepare for the next center-of-attention event, so I’ll be ready for battle this time.</p>
