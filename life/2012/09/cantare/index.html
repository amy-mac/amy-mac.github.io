      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>I saw an audition notice for an Adult community chorus a week ago and got excited and thought, &ldquo;I should audition!&rdquo; and then was immediately plagued by doubts thinking about how stressful music auditions are, how terrible I usually do in them because of nervousness, and then how little time I even had to prepare being that it was tech week for the play that I&rsquo;m in. I made an audition appointment anyway, knowing that in the 5 days before the audition I would probably cancel. A couple days later I mentioned it to my good friend and old vocal coach PJ and he encouraged me to do it, of course, but I&rsquo;ve always thought that he is biased in his faith in my singing because he&rsquo;s worked with me so much and doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize how badly I do in auditions, so I often find his optimism annoying.</p>

<p>The weekend arrived, I was exhausted and broken from tech week and stress, and I hadn&rsquo;t even had the chance to start thinking about an audition song. I spent a couple hours going through my sheet music, singing dozens of songs trying to find a good piece to do, and as usual became exasperated and proclaimed that I probably was going to cancel the audition. The next morning I woke up even more exhausted, thought about all the things I needed to get done that day, realized I still didn&rsquo;t have an audition song picked out and decided to officially cancel the appointment. Upon voicing this decision my boyfriend starting running around the house getting things done that I said I needed to do, exclaiming, &ldquo;Damnit, I&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to get you to that audition.&rdquo; I was stressed, nervous, and as usual afraid of failure, but I couldn&rsquo;t turn down the love and support that wonderful man gives me time and time again. So I narrowed it down to two songs, had him help me choose, bought the sheet music online, printed it out, and got my ass in gear.</p>

<p>I drove to the audition, getting more nervous by the minute, and then told myself, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not competing against anyone else. They just want to see what your voice is like.&rdquo; I went in there, shook the hands with the Vocal Director and was relieved to see there was no one in the room but him. I answered a few questions, and then he sat down at the piano to play and I showed him where my 32 bars started. He said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just start from the beginning; we have time.&rdquo; then he started playing the intro and I thought, &ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My body shakes when I get nervous, and I realized that my hands had already started doing so, but he couldn&rsquo;t see me and that made me feel better. I started singing, nervously at first, but stronger as it went along. I didn&rsquo;t do my absolute best, but I did well enough. I was pleased with my singing, which rarely happens when I sing at an audition. Afterwards he put me through a test where I had to listen to what he played then sing it back. I passed that, and then he asked me what part I usually sing. I told him I usually sing 1st Soprano but could do 2nd Soprano if need be. He then shook my hand and said, &ldquo;Welcome aboard, we&rsquo;re glad to have you.&rdquo; I was surprised and ecstatic.</p>

<p>To some people it may seem silly to go through such an ordeal for something as simple as a community choir, but being able to audition well is a big accomplishment for me, and something I continually struggle with. For years I&rsquo;ve tried to get better at not psyching myself out, and have ended up so frustrated because it doesn&rsquo;t seem to ever get better, or easier. I often lament, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being able to sing well if I can&rsquo;t prove it to anyone when it matters?&rdquo; and try to be content just singing around the house, but I never am content with that.</p>

<p>So now I get to sing every Sunday with this choir, and I get to perform with them in a few months, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>

<p>Sidenote: In case anyone was wondering I sang the song &ldquo;I Ought to Cry&rdquo; from <em>Little by Little</em>.</p>
