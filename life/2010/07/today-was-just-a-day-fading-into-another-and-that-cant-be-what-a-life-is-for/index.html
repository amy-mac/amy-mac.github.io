        <blockquote>
  Today was just a day fading into another and that can't be what a life is for...
</blockquote>

<p>Last night I told Ronin about how much I’ve been struggling lately and why. He said, <em>“Damn Amy, I feel the need to say this. I don’t get your life. You’re WAY TOO GOOD of a person for the life you got/get. It upsets me.”</em> It was nice to know that someone thinks that way. Normally I beat myself up over how most bad things that happen to me are just my own fault, but that really isn’t true in this instance.</p>

<p>I told Ronin how frightened I am of people being able to change that quickly, and how I don’t know how I can put trust in anyone, and how I never want to be that close to someone again. Right now I’m a recluse hiding from the world, because I feel more alone out there than I do at home by myself. I try very hard not to wallow over recent events; it just seems to be in my face more than I’d like, and while I try to distract myself, those instances are brief that I succeed. I drove by a restaurant called Le Cheval and started laughing and thought, “I can’t wait to tell Paul,” and then I got sad because of course I can’t, and it just wasn’t fun to not get to share that amusement. These days I live completely in my head, and I guess on here where I know no one will ever actually read, because it’s easy to be invisible in public, isn’t it?</p>

<p>I want to be productive but I’m finding it so hard to be productive. Every night when I go to bed I stare at my keyboard and think, “I should start playing again,” and then I don’t. I feel like a failure. All those things that I wanted to do in my new apartment with my space and freedom. To be fair I’m still unpacking so it’s hard to work on arts &amp; crafts etc. but I know I wouldn’t be even if the boxes were gone. About the only thing I’ve been successfully doing is singing. It’s rare that anything can stop me from that, though now I cry more when singing ballads.</p>

<p>I’m so confused right now. I don’t think that time passing is going to solve this, like it usually does. I think I need to change how I’m living. Obviously this is getting worse rather than better. I need to finish my website, read my books, live my life. I still want to do great things. I want to be extraordinary. I just need to stop investing myself so much in kindred spirits so that I stop losing pieces of myself. I’m tired of being a great friend and no one appreciating it. People are my downfall and yet I can’t seem to wash my hands of them, because of that blasted urge I’ve always had to share, hoping that someone will care.</p>

<p>While unpacking I found this quote book I started when I was 12. I had no idea it still existed. I flipped through it and started bawling when I came across this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  How delightful it would be to converse intimately with someone of the same mind, sharing with him the pleasures of uninhibited conversation on the amusing and foolish things of this world, but such friends are hard to find.
  <cite>Kenko</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>I know I shouldn’t let other people influence how I think of myself but I can’t help thinking if so many people can walk away from me so easily and never spare me another thought again, there’s got to be something wrong with me right? Am I that unlikeable? I know I’m weird, but I have so many positive attributes. Ronin said I’m too good of a person; maybe that’s exactly what my problem is. I’m a good person and I let people walk all over me, take advantage of me. I used to be harder than this. I wasn’t always such a timid weakling.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, if he had said sorry and then we never spoke again, I would have been fine. I was detached at that point. I am mad at myself for how easily he charmed me into opening myself back up again. I just can’t seem to get over that quick turnaround. Maybe I’m mad that I believed him.</p>

<p>Analyzing this over and over and trying to understand it and run from it at the same time isn’t going to help me move on though. Time for my nightly distraction.</p>
