        <p>I went to this completely amazing park last weekend in Berkeley. It’s right on the bay, and if it weren’t for the infamous SF fog you’d be able to see the city, alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and so on. I walked around, took pictures, enjoyed the beauty, sat and read. Staring out at the bay with the wind blasting away I suddenly remembered sitting on that pier in Charleston and thinking that I must always live by the water. I stared out and I thought, “How could anyone possibly be unhappy amongst this?” It was a glorious feeling. While I was sitting and reading a few young French people came by and tried to play frisbee. They weren’t very good at it but I rather enjoyed listening to them. I fantasized about them asking me to play and responding to them in French. There was an older man wind skateboarding—something I had never seen before, and the pure joy on his face was contagious. I kept grinning every time he passed by.</p>

<p>I’ve been going out of my way to do things out of my comfort zone, be more social, etc. I’m very proud of myself, and have been having a good time. I’ve also been okay for about 4 days now. I’m hoping that the bad part is over and this will continue. I’m even starting to be motivated to work on my website again, and I’m so antsy to go to Spain. I bought my plane tickets last week. I got my record player up and running again, which makes my heart glow. I haven’t gotten to use it since 2007 when Cliff and I lived together. It’s funny, with unpacking, all these memories that are floating back.</p>

<p>Lots of auditions coming up and I’m equally excited and nervous, as usual. I’m just sad I will be out of town for <em>Cabaret</em> callbacks. At least I’m not going to be too old for that one any time soon. Just wish I had some good headshots since everyone else has them around here. I guess being able to survive an audition is more important though. I’m seriously considering taking a shot before the next one. The director did tell me to take drugs before auditions lol but of course I’m not going to do that because I’m a little miss goodie two-shoes, as my sister calls me.</p>
