      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>I went to a theatre festival on Sunday and though I enjoyed getting out of the house and the beauty of the Yerba Buena Gardens, I was a little disappointed with most of the acts I saw. I suppose I was just choosing the wrong performances to see. The highest quality one was probably <em>Jerry Springer: The Opera</em>, though I am not a fan of Jerry Springer the show. I also understand what Ron meant now when he said the show is not for the faint of heart. I was pretty wide eyed through most of their snippet.</p>

<p>This has been the week of auditions and it has exhausted me mentally and emotionally. I auditioned for <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em> on Monday night. I thought there was going to be readings, etc, but as usual there wasn&rsquo;t. My audition was just so-so, and they cut me off before my 32 bars was finished. Most of the girls there sang &ldquo;My New Philosophy&rdquo;. They all sounded the same and they all got callbacks; I did not. On Tuesday night I auditioned for <em>Cabaret</em>. I ended up singing a song I learned just that day: Not For the Life of Me from <em>Thoroughly Modern Millie</em>. I had a great audition and felt so good about it afterwards. I told them though that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attend callbacks. I didn&rsquo;t receive a callback. I wonder if the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t attend was why. I really thought I had it in the bag. On Wednesday night I auditioned for <em>Gypsy</em>. I was going to sing Not For the Life of Me again since I had such a good audition with it the night before, but I panicked after hearing the other auditioners and sang &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Not&rdquo; instead. It wasn&rsquo;t a great audition. The dancing was extremely easy. I guess the director was desperate for people because he told us we were all cast and that callbacks on Monday would determine exactly as what. I was being considered for Mazeppa, because of my tallness, but I am frustrated that they were considering me for Mazeppa and not Electra or Tessie Tura. The latter two are both in my range vocally but Mazeppa is absolutely not. I can&rsquo;t sing low, I can&rsquo;t sing in a grindy manner. I really wish I could, but I had to accept at a certain point that I was never going to be a sultry alto. The musical director had me trying to sing the part and couldn&rsquo;t get me to do what he wanted since, hello, I&rsquo;m a soprano. I had to talk-sing most of it and the few points that were higher were in my pretty head voice, which they don&rsquo;t want. I tried to be raspy but it just made my throat hurt. I also had to do an improvisational burlesque performance to You Gotta Get a Gimmick and though I was trying to be ugly and funny I was told that I was too sexy and erotic; THAT&rsquo;S not something I usually hear. So I&rsquo;ll find out on Tuesday if I was cast as Mazeppa, but I&rsquo;m definitely in the ensemble of the show.</p>

<p>Today I was feeling very downtrodden and defeated. What&rsquo;s the use of having a beautiful voice and being a great actress if I&rsquo;m not able to show it to anyone? I feel like I&rsquo;m never going to have the chance to show this area what I&rsquo;m capable of, and it&rsquo;s all because I suck at musical auditions. If people did readings at auditions then I&rsquo;d have an edge but that&rsquo;s not going to happen and my fear of singing at auditions is not going to get any better. I&rsquo;m done. I want to go back to doing just straight plays but there&rsquo;s hardly any ever going on and when they are I usually can&rsquo;t audition because of work. I just can&rsquo;t take the stress of auditioning for musicals anymore. Maybe if I move back to one of the areas where I&rsquo;ve already proven myself, then okay, but Bay Area, screw you.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of personal time to myself lately, so I&rsquo;ve been feeling overwhelmed and stressed at home, as well as work. I&rsquo;ve finally got a working template in place for my website but have hardly any time to fill it with actual content. I really wish this process was moving faster. While riding BART to the airport today I kept almost crying while lost in my thoughts. I started wondering if there is even a point in making my website, wondering what I am doing with my life, where my place is in the world, how insignificant I am and everything else, occasionally thinking, &ldquo;Just do what makes you happy,&rdquo; and almost crying because theatre is what makes me most happy; it always has.</p>

<p>I babysat Aiden the other day. I tried to work and watch him at the same time but he was a lot of work and took my full attention most of the time. It made me realize once again how much I&rsquo;m not ready to have children. I loved spending the time with him, and loved how he&rsquo;d stop crying whenever I sang Not For the Life of Me to him (he didn&rsquo;t seem to like songs from Cabaret though, I think it&rsquo;s because the former says the word &ldquo;baby&rdquo;), but I realized that it&rsquo;s just not plausible to get work done while taking care of a baby. So how would I support my child and me? I suppose that if I had one of those carrying pouches then I could type, etc. while technically holding the baby, but what if I&rsquo;m no longer working from home? I doubt they let you take your baby to work with you. Thinking through all this I started to feel that I may never have the joy of raising children. I might end up one of those invisible people who no one notices dead for weeks.</p>

<p>Airports are a great place for writing. I sometimes think about taking up real writing again but I can&rsquo;t even find time for everything else. I wish I had more time for my own interests; maybe someday. I&rsquo;m so tired of traveling. I want my life back. For now though, it&rsquo;s off to find the next flight to sit standby for. That could be a metaphor for my life.</p>
