      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Finally have a moment to breathe, and therefore post. Just got back from Colorado where I was running the Shining Stars Foundation&rsquo;s 2nd largest annual event and being my amazing business woman self. I&rsquo;m only home for 9 days before I have to head back again to run the silent auction at a different event. Besides barely sleeping and working nonstop, the highlights of this year&rsquo;s event was that for the first time ever I made the Adam Falls hike, so now I actually know where it is. It&rsquo;s quite beautiful up there and I&rsquo;ll have to make the trip again when I&rsquo;m not stressing out and there&rsquo;s not a storm coming in. The Grand Lake Chocolate store somehow made an improvement to the ice cream that has been my favorite for 10 years. They have a new flavor called Death by Even More Chocolate.</p>

<p>The more time I spend around Megan, the more I like her even more. This is wonderful and gives me great hope for the future of the office. It&rsquo;s nice having a new friend too; her and I are quite similar. Cookie bought me a new hat at my favorite store, because she wanted to treat a girl to something (she has a son). So now I have an awesome blue hat to add to my collection. Cookie also bought me this mug I&rsquo;ve been lusting over for two months, as a surprise gift for fixing her computer&hellip;again (something I do on a regular basis). I&rsquo;m in love with this mug. It&rsquo;s so perfect for me. Oh, another highlight of the week was getting to ride on Andy&rsquo;s motorcycle with him back to Winter Park after the rafting trip. I was forced to wear a helmet and motorcycle jacket, which dampened my usual euphoria the wind creates, but still great nonetheless. During the 45 minute trip back to Winter Park I decided that I am going to save up for a motorcycle, since I only have the joy of being a passenger on one a couple times a year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m growing increasingly excited about my trip to Spain, but am really quite sad that I don&rsquo;t have a better camera to take with me. I got my blood work bill yesterday and thought, &ldquo;Wow, I could have just not had those tests done and bought a nice camera or a big screen TV.&rdquo; I won tickets to see Joseph &amp; the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, which is pretty great because free tickets are the only reason I would have seen the show. I&rsquo;ve been completely stressing out about the 3 auditions I have next week. Well, not Gypsy or Cabaret so much, because I don&rsquo;t care that much about Gypsy, and I won&rsquo;t be cast in Cabaret since I can&rsquo;t attend callbacks, but Spelling Bee is really tormenting me. The only thing that I&rsquo;m fully satisfied would be a good audition piece is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Not&rdquo; from Little by Little, which of course is an extremely obscure musical that sheet music doesn&rsquo;t exist for &gt;.&lt; I&rsquo;m just going to have to settle on something, and I&rsquo;ve already psyched myself out about it. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to sing &ldquo;Special&rdquo; from Avenue Q for the Gypsy audition. Haven&rsquo;t really decided on Cabaret yet, though there are quite a few that would work just fine. I&rsquo;ll probably since &ldquo;I Love a Piano&rdquo; if it gets down to the wire.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m home I suddenly feel overwhelmed with things I want to do in my free time again; something that is not an issue when I&rsquo;m in Colorado and working constantly. I want to play piano, practice Spanish, educate myself, go to the gym, read books, work on my website, finish unpacking, watch movies, etc. I deactivated my facebook account today. Finally facebook has made it possible for me to do so, but when I realized that I still hadn&rsquo;t, because I go there to check auditions, and use it as a conduit for my scrabble playing. But today, after I had been doing well the last couple weeks, I happened to go there and see a bunch of pictures of the asshole &amp; the manipulative harlot together. No matter what I do to block myself from seeing anything, it always somehow shoves itself in front of my face. So either I delete all our mutual friends, which I&rsquo;m not willing to do, because unlike him I don&rsquo;t just toss friendships away for no reason on a whim, or I remove myself. So I did and hopefully this relapse into sadness and anger will evaporate again by tomorrow.</p>

<p>On the bright side of things I&rsquo;ll be at a theatre festival in SF all day on Sunday before the first of the three auditions. Hurrah! I&rsquo;m totally looking forward to it; I might even attempt to be social and somehow make some thespian friends.</p>
