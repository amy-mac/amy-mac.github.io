        <p>I think I’m going to take down my portfolio page until I have some time to complete it, because what’s there right now is not only such a small portion of my portfolio, but it’s really a bad representation of my art as a whole, that I don’t want anyone thinking that’s all I’ve got. Part of what actually was holding me back from taking the time to complete it in the first place was wondering if there was even a point in taking the time. Lately I’ve been worried that I have my ladder against the wrong wall—to use a term from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>—and was striving to figure some of that out before expending the effort. I’m considering sticking it out in the field of design and maybe not pursuing video editing. Strangely enough though, I’m trying to get back into motion graphics. There’s more of a need for that, as evidenced by Tomás telling me he could get me a job in a heartbeat if I was good with AfterEffects. Of course, if he had it his way my next career would be as a breeder <em>smirk</em>. I’m just kidding, he’s extremely supportive of my career interests and goals, he just wants babies at the same time.</p>

<p>This weekend I thought something had happened to him and it was agonizing; especially the not knowing for sure part. I tried not to let my imagination run away with me, but I’ve lost so many people throughout my life that I know how very real it is and I always fear the worst. It made me realize how much I don’t want to lose him. Not a silly, “How could I ever live without him?” because obviously I can, and would, were something unfortunate to happen to him. It just made me realize that a life with him is what I desire very much, and I’m willing to commit to that now. He frustrates the hell out of me, but that’s only because I care about him, which was another small realization.</p>

<p>I read <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne for the first time. I wish I had read it before 2005, even though I know things are as they should be. After reading it I very much wanted to be Hester Prynne for Halloween, my semi-fictional kindred spirit. Tomás is everything I’ve ever wanted, so much so that it still feels too good to be true, and so surreal. I’m not going to be a fool anymore; I’m going to give in, and not throw away this gift that I have earned and waited for.</p>
