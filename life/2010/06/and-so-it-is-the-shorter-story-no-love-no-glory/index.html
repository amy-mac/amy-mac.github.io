      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it&rsquo;s been 4 &frac12; years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it&rsquo;s pretty exciting moving into a place that I&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.</p>

<p>I enrolled in a community college in Oakland. Classes are too cheap here to not take advantage of them, even if it&rsquo;s just taking one dance class a semester, etc. There already doesn&rsquo;t seem to be enough time in the day for all the education and knowledge I crave, but sleep is for the weak, right?</p>

<p>I went to the doctor to get my thyroid checked and had my first ever bloodwork done. A lot of things costing me money lately, so I&rsquo;m pretty broke but I feel like it&rsquo;s okay because things are progressing, and that&rsquo;s what is creating it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my thyroid, and I&rsquo;m not anemic, everything else is good too, BUT my vitamin D is extremely low, so the doctor says I have to start taking 5,000 mg a day and that in a couple months I might be feeling a little better. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had any time to work on my website lately. I&rsquo;ve been totally swamped at work. I&rsquo;ve basically been doing nothing but artwork and it&rsquo;s taking up all my time. All these deadlines are occurring at once, so I&rsquo;ve been having to put in a lot of extra hours. I can&rsquo;t complain though, I am very lucky to get paid to do artwork. My iMac is finally back into my hands and it&rsquo;s oh so glorious, though I&rsquo;m having trouble once again trying to deactivate my CS3 on my laptop, so right now I can&rsquo;t use InDesign on my iMac &gt;.&lt; Oh, on that note, I was able to get Dreamweaver CS5 from TechSoup when we put in our nonprofit order so looking forward to giving that a whirl sometime soon. I upgraded my iPod Touch to 4.0 and it keeps startling me when the icons move differently than they use to. Checked out iBooks and I guess it&rsquo;s okay, but you still can&rsquo;t curl up with that&ndash;it&rsquo;s not a substitute, it&rsquo;s a backup; at least that&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>

<p>At first I was doing pretty okay, I went from sadness to numbness then to anger, and then back to sadness and bursting into tears in public places. I&rsquo;ve been having some pretty bad dreams too. Right now I think I&rsquo;m more frustrated than anything. I congratulate myself whenever I realize I&rsquo;ve gone a moment, sometimes even an hour without thinking about any of it. When I do think about it I reassure myself that a day will come when none of it will matter, like so many times before; though I&rsquo;m dead set on there never being another instance like this in my life. I&rsquo;m trying to continue life as normal, keep looking ahead and pretending like I&rsquo;m just fine. It&rsquo;s back to living in my head again, bottling it all up, until I burst. I watched <em>The Young Victoria</em> the other night and at the end I was crying and couldn&rsquo;t stop. I cried myself to sleep that night. I was upset because it was a lie, like everything else and everyone in life. I don&rsquo;t care that it was based on real life; it only upset me more that it was, because I want something real and something true, and love simply isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>He laughed at me for protesting that no one likes me or misses me and days later he neither liked me or missed me anymore. PJ says people don&rsquo;t just change their feelings overnight but he&rsquo;s naive. He says that I can&rsquo;t take people so literally, but he doesn&rsquo;t understand. I know he feels nothing, nor probably will ever spare a thought towards me again, and that&rsquo;s what frightens me. I don&rsquo;t know how I could ever be that close to someone again without being afraid that they&rsquo;ll stop being my friend the next day. I think it wouldn&rsquo;t bother me as much if I hadn&rsquo;t gone from one extreme to the other in 48 hours. Mais c&#39;est la vie, n&#39;est pas?</p>

<p>So what do I do? I keep to myself, I do the little things that make me happy, and one day we&rsquo;ll all join nonexistence. I plan on making use of every one of my minutes and making of them what I can. Today is the first day of the rest of my life.</p>
